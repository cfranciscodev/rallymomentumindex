Clemmons was struck twice in the back and once in the hip after he fled from Lippert after a traffic stop. Police say Clemmons had a gun and refused to drop it. CLOSE Theeda Murphy with the Justice for Jocques Coalition speaks Friday night at a protest in Nashville About 70 people marched behind members of the Clemmons family, carrying signs that accused the mayor and chief of police of being complicit and calling for Lippert's termination. They started in Fannie Mae Dees Park, also known as Dragon Park, which organizers chose for its location in a part of town known for being affluent and predominantly white."We want to show that Nashville is unified in support of change, that people who are normally not sitting at the table should be sitting at the table," said Theeda Murphy, an organizer with the Justice for Jocques Coalition. "And we want those people to be seen out of context."Protesters work on signs for a silent protest Friday, May 12, 2017 in response to the Nashville attorney deciding not to file charges against a Metro police officer in the death of Jocques Clemmons.

Blaine Whited fell in behind them, occasionally ordering them out of the street over his patrol car loudspeaker."If a vehicle strikes you, it will be your fault," he said.They remained in the street without incident.Clemmie Greenlee holds a sign at a silent protest Friday, May 12, 2017 in response to the Nashville district attorney deciding not to file charges against a Metro police officer in the death of Jocques Clemmons.
