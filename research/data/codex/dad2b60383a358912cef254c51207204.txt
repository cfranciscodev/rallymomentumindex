D.C. police said there were no protest-related street closures. On social media, organizers had called for a nationwide walk-out at 1 p.m. with the motto "Hands Up.” In the District, a group of about two dozen protesters gathered just after 1 p.m. in front of the Justice Department. One protester told the crowd, "We must love each other and protect each other! We have nothing to lose but our chains.” Protesters rally Monday afternoon in front of the Department of Justice building in Washington. (Victoria St. Martin/The Washington Post) One organizer, Erika Totten, said, "Stand with us or get stuck in traffic.” Totten, a self-proclaimed soccer mom from Alexandria, said she was arrested Sunday after another Ferguson-related protest on Interstate 395 in the District. She said she felt honored sitting in a jail cell. Totten said she's protesting for her young daughter and son. "I have to worry about someone looking at my baby like they're a threat,” she said. She said wears bright colors when she runs now and even asked her husband not to wear a hoodie when he jogs. "A hoodie on a black body means you are a criminal, a threat. That your death will be justified.” She said she tells her kids, not to watch out for strangers, but to "watch out for the cops.” When she heard about Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Totten flew there. She said she was tear gassed and shot at for three days. Scenes from the 1 p.m. protest in front of the Justice Department.
