But the event was disrupted when protesters began ranting. (Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography Office) Mayor de Blasio got caught between the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Lives Matter movement Monday when protesters interrupted him at a holiday event in Brooklyn. De Blasio was delivering remarks about King at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Fort Greene when several protesters jumped to their feet and ranted about the NYPD's "broken windows" policy, and the deportation of undocumented immigrants.

About 10 officers assigned to keep the protesters out of the church eventually escorted them out the backdoor as the mayor continued to speak. Outside, about 250 demonstrators marched in the church's courtyard, waving picket signs and chanting Black Lives Matter slogans as dozens of cops stood watch. Mayoral spokeswoman Monica Klein later defended de Blasio's record on immigration, community affairs and police policy.
