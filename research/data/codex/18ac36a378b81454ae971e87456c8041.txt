Protesters, many carrying placards gathered at St David's Hall before marching to Queen Street where speakers from the Black Lives Matter movement addressed the crowd.

The scene in Queen Street, Cardiff Earlier this week traffic heading to Heathrow airport was brought to a standstill by Black Lives Matter protesters lying on an M4 slip road. The Cardiff protest followed a vigil in the city last month outside the National Museum Cardiff in a show of solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement. It followed similar protests around the world after the shooting of black men by US police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and St Paul, Minnesota. Those deaths were followed by the reprisal shooting of five officers in Dallas, Texas. Music was played, guest speakers addressed the crowd and a minute's silence was held, followed by applause in the evening sunshine. The event had been described as a vigil, rather than a march, and the public were asked to go in peace and leave in peace. Black Lives Matter is an activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence towards black people. The organisation, which began in 2013, regularly organises protests around the deaths of black people by police officers. Demonstrations have increased across most parts of America as thousands took to the streets in anger at the deaths of the two black men – Alton Sterling and Philando Castile – in America. Then at a protest rally in Dallas five police officers were killed by a sniper. At the Cardiff vigil last month organiser Matthew Reed said he wanted the event to have positive vibes. He said: "The best thing is for people to do is come in peace and leave in peace. "We're trying to show the UK that we can do it as well and do it without any violence. "I thought it was needed for Cardiff now.” WalesOnlineFollow @WalesOnlineCommentsShow more commentsMore OnM4Cardiff NewsallMost ReadMost RecentCoronavirusFirst Minister expected to keep five mile advice but allow shops to re-open in Wales from MondayFirst Minister Mark Drakeford is due to make an announcement on Friday following a review of lockdown measuresNew rules for hairdressers include no small talkUK NewsThere are also new rules on wearing coats to a salon and how to leave a tipLive coronavirus updates as health minister says 2,400 care home patients and staff in Wales have tested positiveCoronavirusThe news comes one day before the First Minister is set to make announcements about the potential easing of lockdown measures in WalesHuge cannabis factory with drugs worth £630,000 found in Commercial Hotel in PontypriddCourtsNeighbours alerted police after the smell of drugs became unbearable.
