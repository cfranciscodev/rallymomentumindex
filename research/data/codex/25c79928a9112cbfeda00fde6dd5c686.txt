Tim Walz urges caution. From the back of a City Hall meeting room, Michaela Day joined some two dozen protesters Wednesday night in demanding answers from the Falcon Heights City Council. "Why don't you tell St. Anthony that if they don't fire Yanez for murdering, that you will cancel their contract?” Day shouted. "That would show that you care.” With the July 6 shooting death of Philando Castile heavy on their minds, the group abruptly halted a well-attended council workshop on the future of the city's policing contract with the city of St. Anthony. "Why are we still paying murderers" and "Convict Yanez Now" are among signs held at meeting pic.twitter.com/KjOn7Mvgn1 — FredMelo, Reporter (@FrederickMelo) September 8, 2016 Even for some like-minded audience members, it was a frustrating conclusion to the night. For weeks, Paula and Bruce Mielke have helped lead discussions at their Falcon Heights home among neighbors appalled at the officer-involved shooting death of Castile, who was black, during a traffic stop conducted by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez. Seeking change, their "Falcon Heights Can Do Better” coalition recently presented the mayor with a proposal for a city-led task force to study policing models around the country. Their goal was to have the task force consider opting out of a three-year contract the city holds with the St. Anthony Police Department, which is embroiled in the investigation of Castile's death, and report back to the city council on alternative contracts by Dec. 31. "A small city can be nimble,” Paula Mielke said in an interview. "Why not be the model for the nation?” On Wednesday evening, the discussion was short-lived. The Falcon Heights City Council met in a workshop to debate the particulars of forming a city task force, or joining a tri-city task force with St. Anthony and Lauderdale, but the conversation quickly turned into shouts and protests, with members of advocacy coalitions hoisting protest placards and calling the workshop insufficient. Some two dozen or more protesters from AR14 for Justice, St. Paul Black Lives Matter, Black Man Stand Up and Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar demanded that Falcon Heights immediately terminate its policing contract with St. Anthony and seek the prosecution of Yanez. "Why do we need to have a study to collect more data? It's right here,” said Brooklyn Park resident Jeff Hassan, a member of the African American Leadership Forum, pointing later to a newspaper article on racial disparities in the St. Anthony department's arrest rates. Mayor Peter Lindstrom soon called for a recess, and efforts to reconvene the workshop a few minutes later also dissolved into shouting before the council left for the night. Members of "Falcon Heights Can Do Better” were disappointed with the outcome, but they, too, shared some of the protesters' concerns. Audience member asks AR14 and other groups that are none too happy: "who would you pick to police the city?" pic.twitter.com/dMYCXve6Vy — FredMelo, Reporter (@FrederickMelo) September 8, 2016 The mayor "has kept his focus on making it work with St. Anthony,” Paula Mielke, said in the interview. "Our resolution is focused on other policing models, to look at contracting with another city.” The mayor's modified version of their proposal calls for a city-led task force to meet well into 2017 before making recommendations on policing changes by next May — a time frame that the Mielkes call unnecessarily slow. The council may vote on which task force model to adopt — if any — on Sept. 14. "There's so much unhealed grief in this room,” audience member and St. Paul resident Carrie Pomeroy said on social media. "A mere task force feels inadequate, too removed, abstract.” Tags: Philando Castile shooting Frederick Melo | St. Paul reporter Frederick Melo was once sued by a reader for $2 million but kept on writing.
