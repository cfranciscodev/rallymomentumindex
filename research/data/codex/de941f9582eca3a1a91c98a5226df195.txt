"There's a lot of awareness, but we want action.”The gathering was largely silent up until about 8 p.m. when counter-protesters George "K-Rack" Johnson and Ray Dunkin arrived. Both identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. In the past, the group has targeted Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer online for her role in protesting the equestrian statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, which has since been removed from what is now Health Sciences Park.Several of the protesters crossed the street to confront the two men.

For every action, there's a reaction," Bond said. The crowd who stood behind Bond during the confrontation was formed by both white and black Memphians. "I was so impressed to see so many white allies," Bond said. "Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"By 9 p.m., about a dozen more people had joined the protest with two dozen more watching from nearby and filming. About 50 MPD officers were on the scene with about 30 standing between the protesters and the two counter-demonstrators, who stood outside the MPD precinct on Union Avenue. About 40 MPD vehicles and a K-9 unit were also present.No other counter-protesters were seen joining Johnson and Dunkin, who left the lawn of the precinct around 9 p.m., telling MPD officers that they appreciated them. At least two individuals were handcuffed during the protest. Lt. Karen Rudolph said she could not provide a reason for the detainment until a report had been entered into the system.A man is detained by Memphis police officers during a protest outside the Union Avenue police station on Wednesday night, May 27, 2020, in Midtown Memphis.

He listened as Bond described what she felt was unfair treatment from police officers at the scene. After Bond said her piece, Hines asked the protesters if they would show the same enthusiasm and outrage for "those individuals, those victims, those fathers, those sons and brothers that were killed," in reference to the homicides that occurred in Memphis over the weekend.Hines told Bond that if she had a complaint about the conduct of an officer, she should file it with the police department. Hines, flanked by several officers, walked behind the barricade. He then motioned for the more than 20 officers lined up behind the barricade across Union Avenue at Barksdale Street to withdraw and back away. They did, slowly and resumed their positions about 30 feet behind the barricades. The protesters then turned and headed west down Union again.
