The Fox's have a real estate business, Fox Homes, and an interior design company. They landed their own show on HGTV called 'Stay or Sell' where they renovated homes, and now they're unveiling Foxwell Shoppe. The store officially opened this week at 44th and France Avenue in Edina. Since the Fox's offer interior design, a shop with home goods was a logical next step. And now they've relocated all their businesses into this location. And there's another thing that's working out for them; HGTV. They have another project with the network in the works though they couldn't share the details quite yet. 4 hours ago video Town Ball Returns 1 day ago video Bike shops see surge in sales during pandemic 2 days ago video Father's Day gift ideas from local makers 6 days ago video Fill in your summer reading list with these picks 6 days ago video Union Depot's popular Train Days goes virtual 6 days ago Pets & Animals View More 3 dogs die after shooting in St. Paul, Minnesota Tuesday night Three dogs died after a shooting in St. Paul, Minnesota Tuesday night. 18 hours ago Retired police dog rescued after getting stuck in park bench 5 days ago 16-year-old Minnesota girl reels in massive grouper in Gulf of Mexico 6 days ago Owners say dog ejected from car in Shakopee crash 'OK by some miracle' June 10 Goldendoodle found after going missing in crash on Hwy 169 in Shakopee, Minnesota June 9 Video: Bear trapped inside SUV freed by deputies June 6 Money View More Minnesota unemployment rate hits 9.9 percent, highest ever recorded in state Minnesota's unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in May, which is the highest rate ever recorded int he state. 1 hour ago 1.5 million more laid-off workers seek unemployment benefits 6 days ago Are we getting a second coronavirus stimulus check?
