The rally drew a crowd of about 75 people who marched from Central Park to police headquarters. (John Woike / Hartford Courant) Police shot Dowdell, a 20-year-old rapper known as Gangstalicious, and two teenagers inside a car they'd just pulled over. The five officers were looking for suspects in a series of violent carjackings, and said the car sped toward them when they got out of their cruisers. Protesters on Wednesday said they're frustrated that 10 months after the shooting, law enforcement has not yet released police dashboard camera video of the shooting. "Release the tapes,” the crowd chanted after marching to the sidewalk outside police headquarters. New Britain police, however, don't have the tapes. The investigation was turned over the state police and is being directed by Fairfield County State's Attorney John Smriga.
