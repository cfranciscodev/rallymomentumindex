The movement, currently sweeping America and the UK - with demonstrations throughout the country since the fatal shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling by police officers in the USA - came to Merseyside this afternoon. And it led to a series of emotional public speeches from Mzee Mohammed's mum Karla, whose son fell ill in Liverpool ONE shopping centre, and was restrained by police and security staff in a manner which has angered the teen's family, before he died on Wednesday evening. Black Lives Matter march from Lime street to the Bombed out church. The mum addressed a crowd of around 300 marchers at Lime Street station before walkers processed down Ranelagh Street, turned up into Bold Steet, along Slater Street, up Duke Street, and down Berry Street to the Bombed Out church. Mrs Mohammed made continual criticisms of Merseyside Police and their handling of her son after a video emerged of officers and paramedics tending to a dying Mzee, with handcuffs still clasped to his wrists while he lay motionless and unconscious. Mum and sister of Mzee Mohammed, Karla and Melissa, join Black Lives Matter march in Liverpool The mum said: "I want to ask the Lord to see justice for my son. "I will not rest, I will walk in my son's shoes until I get answers, and anyone who had a hand in my boy's death will be brought to justice.” She added: "My son will not be a number or a statistic. His death will not be in vain.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in8Cancel Play now Mzee died just before 8pm on Wednesday after he was taken in an ambulance to the Royal Liverpool Hospital. Merseyside Police said they had received reports of a man running into a house in the Toxteth area at around 6pm "in a distressed state.” Further calls were made to police, they said, about Mzee "behaving erratically at a number of locations throughout the city centre, including Liverpool One with a knife.” He then suffered a medical episode, a police spokeswoman said. Two dads have reported that Mzee threatened their 13-year-old daughters at knifepoint while demanding their mobile phones, but the former Shorefields School pupil's family say they do not believe he was involved in those alleged crimes. Cries of "Black Lives Matter, Mzee's Life Mattered” were shouted out as the march snaked through the city centre. Black Lives Matter march from Lime street to the Bombed out church. At the Bombed Out church, Mrs Mohammed told crowds: "I pray with my heart no mother or father go through what I am now. "I would not wish this on my worse enemy. "You can't take the memories, the pictures...my son was not an animal, he was a human being. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson was seen at the end of the march on Berry Street. Black Lives Matter march from Lime street to the Bombed out church. Mrs Mohammed added: "I will walk round the streets of Liverpool, Birmingham, London...I will walk in my son's size 13 boots, which are killing me as I speak, until he is lain to rest in Manchester, Jamaica.” Black Lives Matter protests have taken place throughout Britain following the shooting of black men by US police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and St Paul, Minnesota.
