In a video showing officers arresting Floyd, police officer Derek Chauvin can be seen pressing his knee into Floyd's neck even after he stopped moving. The bystander video showed Floyd pleading that he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers allegedly involved were fired on Tuesday. According to our KBJR 6 crew on scene of the Duluth protest, the protest originated at London Road and 21st Avenue East shortly before 4 p.m. Many in the crowd held signs reading messages like "I can't breathe." About an hour later, Duluth Police arrived on scene and blocked traffic in the area. Protestors moved southwest on London Road. They later moved back toward 21st Avenue East. The protestors also spent time reading the names of African Americans who have died in encounters with police across the country. In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Duluth Police called it a "peaceful gathering." "Our community is outraged and we are there to ensure their right to free speech is preserved," police spokespeople wrote. "We are ready to block traffic for the protesters should they choose to march down the street – we want to ensure they can continue their demonstration safely." President of the NAACP's Duluth branch Stephan Witherspoon also shared a statement reacting to the protest in Duluth. "ALLIES TO THE AFRICAN HERITAGE COMMUNITY, STAND UP, SPEAK OUT, AND HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE WHO SPREAD RACISM LIKE COVID-19!!" Stefan Witherspoon wrote. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson has not yet commented on the protest. The protest was still on going as of 6 p.m. Wednesday. Traffic is blocked in the area and drivers should consider alternate routes. This is a developing story. Check back for updates. KBJR 6 will have the latest on the 10 p.m. newscast.
