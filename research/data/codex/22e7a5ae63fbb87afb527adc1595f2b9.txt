Protests in downtown Nashville: Arrests made for those out after curfewAdam Tamburin and Natalie Allison, Nashville Tennessean Published 12:59 p.m. CT May 30, 2020 | Updated 12:10 a.m. CT May 31, 2020CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE12:06 a.m., Sunday, May 31Nashville Mayor John Cooper released a video late Saturday, condemning the vandalism from people rioting downtown after a peaceful protest earlier in the day."Our Metro Courthouse, iconic for its role in the Civil Rights movement, was the site of much of tonight's reprehensible vandalism," Cooper said in part of his video address.Watch his entire announcement, including information about the current curfew in place, below.CLOSE Speaking about the violent riot that broke out in downtown Nashville Saturday evening, Mayor John Cooper condemns the vandalism of the Metro Courthouse. Nashville Tennessean11:07 p.m. Nashville police say no police officers were injured. At least 6 metro police vehicles were significantly damaged, including a car swarmed while an officer was behind the wheel, police said. Nashville's Metro Courthouse, which includes City Hall offices, and several businesses on Broadway were been damaged, police said.11 p.m. The Equity Alliance, one of the organizers of Saturday's "I Will Breathe Rally," condemned the violent protests and vandalism that took place in downtown Nashville following the rally. Leaders of the statewide non-profit issued the following statement attributed to co-founders and co-executive directors Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson:"Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly."It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today's peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police. "The Equity Alliance condemns and disavows tonight's violent rioting. We urge anyone feeling heartfelt, honest anger over the murder of George Floyd to direct that energy toward November's election. The only true way to change our nation for the better is by taking up our civic duty as Americans and making it clear with our vote that we reject racism in all its forms.”10:38 p.m.A window was broken at the historic Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville tonight.

The officer, Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged with murder.Floyd's death intensified anger and frustration for many who say it is an example of pervasive racism among law enforcement nationwide. Protests have swept through many major cities.Friday night protests in Memphis and Knoxville were peaceful, but violence has erupted during protests in Minneapolis, Louisville and Atlanta.Organizers of the Nashville rally said they wanted to create a peaceful and safe space for people to express their grief and call for change.Organizer Hamid Abdullah said Floyd's death had become a tipping point within the movement against racism and police brutality."More people are coming together. More people are listening. More people are paying attention," Abdullah said. "People are fed up with brutality and they want to do something."Abdullah said he welcomed "all people of good will" to the rally. He said he hoped Cooper would understand the need to make changes to prevent similar deaths in the future.David Hayes leads a chant during a Black Lives Matter rally outside of the Knoxville Police Headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn. on May 29, 2020.

We want to make sure our people are respected."The ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been a prominent part of life in Nashville for years. In 2018, local activists spurred a citywide vote that created the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct.The vote came after a white police officer shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. That officer, Andrew Delke, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. The case is pending.Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com.
