Earlier this month, 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby after his car was stopped in the middle of a roadway. Officers at the scene say Crutcher was acting erratically and was not following commands. According to the affidavit, Shelby asked Crutcher if the vehicle was his and if it was disabled. "He was mumbling to himself and would not answer any of Officer Shelby's questions. Mr. Crutcher kept putting his hands in his pockets and Officer Shelby kept telling him to show his hands. At that point, Mr. Crutcher began walking towards the abandoned vehicle with his hands held up and was not responding to any of Officer Shelby's commands to stop,‚Äù the affidavit claims. In the dash cam video, you see Crutcher walking away from an officer and toward his vehicle with his hands up. Shortly after that, Crutcher was shot. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Last week, Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Shelby with one count of first-degree manslaughter. On Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people attended a prayer rally and walked through the streets in support of Crutcher and his family. The rally and protest remained peaceful, despite another protest that broke out nearby. A pair of anti-protesters held a bullhorn, yelling at the crowd that "Black Lives Matter is racist." Anti-protester yelling "Black Lives Matter is racist." "People see the opportunity. When they see the opportunity, they try to seize in that moment. We're here for a peaceful protest and it will remain that way," said Marq Lewis, with 'We The People Oklahoma.' Protesters in Tulsa A regional law enforcement group also held a rally to "show solidarity" for members of the Tulsa Police Department as the investigation continues into the shooting. A statement was sent by the group saying "First and foremost: Mr. Crutcher's death is a very sad tragedy. Our hearts truly go out to his family members as they mourn the loss of his life, and we pray that his soul is in Heaven.‚Äù Then the statement went on to say "Please understand: This is not about race, and it is not about our black citizens and our law-enforcement community being at odds with each other. This is also not about whether or not Mr. Crutcher's hands were in the air most of the time, whether or not he had a gun, whether or not there were drugs in his vehicle or his body, or whether or not Officer Shelby had a Taser or knew that another officer had one ready to use. This is about whether or not Officer Shelby believed that her safety or life was in danger when she shot Mr. Crutcher with her gun. That is the only issue because that is the standard for our law-enforcement community for using deadly force.‚Äù 36.153982-95.992775 Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Latest News Not clear how many Oklahomans are still waiting for unemployment benefits News / 4 hours ago Video Vehicle goes into Lake Overholser, emergency personnel respond Local / 4 hours ago State leaders worried about aftermath of President Trump's Tulsa rally, Gov.
