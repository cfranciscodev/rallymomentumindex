The three arrested women faces a series of misdemeanor charges.Arrested were a 19-year-old Baton Rouge woman, a 33-year-old Baton Rouge woman and a 45-year-old Houston woman. All three were charged with failure to disperse, aggravated obstruction of a roadway and resisting an officer. The 19-year-old woman was also booked on a misdemeanor charge of battery of a police officer after police say she spit in the face of an officer.The Houston woman was also booked on a charge of illegal possession of a weapon after police say they found a gun concealed in her purse.Late Tuesday afternoon, the Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, published a story saying that the two officers wouldn't face federal charges. The U.S. Department of Justice, which did not comment on the report Tuesday, announced on Wednesday plans for a 1 p.m. press conference.A warrant for the arrest of the 19-year-old woman says she spit at an officer as he tried to remove her from the middle of the highway. While being physically removed from the three-lane, U.S. highway, the warrant says, she "spit a large glob of saliva in an assisting officer's face." After officers put her in the back of a police car, the warrant says, the woman "refused to answer any questions ... and only yelled she was going to get a lawsuit out of this incident."All three women were accused of standing in the highway, which has a speed limit of 50 mph. One of the warrants notes that the highway was dark at that time of night, and standing in the roadway could cause "great bodily danger" to protesters and motorists.One of the warrants says the protesters' position in the middle of the highway was "causing vehicles to come to an abrupt stop and even turn around to avoid the protesters."Police and protesters clashed last year in the initial protests over Sterling's death, and allegations of excessive force by officers resulted in a memorandum of understanding between law enforcement agencies and groups including the American Civil Liberties Union.The ACLU issued a reminder about that memorandum late Tuesday, saying it guaranteed law enforcement agencies' "commitment to use only the level of force objectively reasonable to bring an incident under control and only arrest those who they have reasonable belief to have violated the law.""The residents of Baton Rouge call on all law enforcement agencies to abide by the Memorandum of Understanding and the restraint agreed to by them last summer so communities feel safe engaging in First Amendment-protected activities," Ada Goodly, a Baton Rouge activist and co-coordinator of the legal support team with the National Lawyers Guild said in a statement issued by the ACLU.The U.S. Justice Department's decision not to charge officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake with violating Sterling's civil rights concludes an investigation requested by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards after Sterling was shot dead July 5, 2016, outside the Triple S Food Mart in North Baton Rouge. Sterling had long been known for selling compact discs outside the convenience store, earning the nickname, "C.D. Man." Police said they approached him after receiving an anonymous phone call that someone matching Sterling's description had threatened the caller with a gun.It was not clear whether Sterling was reaching for a gun during the scuffle with the officers. Mobile phone videos of the encounter were widely circulated but were inconclusive on whether Sterling was threatening the officers as he was pinned to the ground. Videos from fixed-position surveillance cameras and ones shot from car dashboards and police body cameras had not been released.Times-Picayune staff writer Kevin Littin contributed to this report.
