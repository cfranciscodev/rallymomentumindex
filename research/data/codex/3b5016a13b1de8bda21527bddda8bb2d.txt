The march began at the Town Green before heading south to the intersection of San Ramon Valley Boulevard and the Town and Country Shopping Center, Danville Police Chief Allan Shields told Patch. Marchers then headed back north before concluding again at the Town Green. There, the crowd took a knee in silence, Cathy Burkholder, executive pastor at the Community Presbyterian Church in Danville, told Patch.
