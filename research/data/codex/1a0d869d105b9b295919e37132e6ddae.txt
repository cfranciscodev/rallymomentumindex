Mothers and fathers walked with their children, generations joined together and walked and sometimes young children played in the inner field of the Loganville City Hall back lawn. City Council members and other city employees were on hand, police were visible in and around the area and some public officials joined in with the marchers. Loganville Mayor Rey Martinez could be seen walking some of the time as well as state Rep. Tom Kirby (R-Loganville). Mayor Rey Martinez walked with protesters in Loganville on June 3, 2020.

She said the purpose of organizing the protest was to help achieve equality. "I don't want to be fearful for my black friends going out at night, going shopping, just doing normal things. I just want everyone to be equal,” said Blair-Griffith, who is herself white. She said the next step is to petition public officials. "Our mayor, our senators, the government, and tell them what we want – for cops to be wearing cameras at all times, more education in the police department and for any officers who do have racists acts or violence to be prosecuted.” Georgia Rep. Tom Kirby (R-Loganville) walked with protestors at Loganville on June 3, 2020.

After walking several laps on what was the old Loganville Elementary School track, the crowd moved to the middle of the field and lay on the ground with their hands behind their backs for almost 9 minutes. This is symbolic of the position George Floyd was in while former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on the neck of Floyd, resulting in his death. Chauvin was subsequently arrested and now faces second-degree murder charges. The protest ended with everybody down on their knees in prayer as local pastors who had joined in the march around the field prayed over them. Another protest is planned in Loganville for 1 p.m. on Saturday. Photo gallery on Youtube link below.
