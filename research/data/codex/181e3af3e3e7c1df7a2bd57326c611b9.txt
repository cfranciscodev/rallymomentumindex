Please enable Javascript to watch this video FERGUSON, MO (KTVI)- There were some tense moments outside of the Ferguson Police Department in the wake of the Department of Justice report being released. Some protesters took to the streets and ended up behind bars. Roughly 50 protesters gathered at police headquarters. They held hands outside the police department. Some even blocked traffic on South Florissant Road. The demonstrations were loud at times but were generally peaceful. A Ferguson police official confirms their officers did arrest four protestors. That worker would not say what the arrests were for saying it would violate the rights of those arrested. Our crew on the scene Wednesday night says the arrests were for people failing to get out of the street. Our partners at the Post-Dispatch say two of those arrested were sitting in the street. St. Louis County Police were called in to assist Ferguson police during the demonstrations. However, Ferguson police did remain in control of the scene. The number of protesters dwindled to a handful after 11p.m. Ferguson police say that the crowd left the area around midnight. No injuries have been reported.

(KDVR) -- The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked the state to reduce health restrictions for a Colorado meat production facility that suffered one of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the state, emails suggest. In an April 11 exchange, Jill Hunsaker Ryan, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), said she would consider less restrictive health guidelines for the JBS meat production plant in Greeley despite a joint public health order she helped to issue the previous day asking for the immediate closure of the facility.

The high court's 5-4 decision only voids president Trump's 2017 attempt to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But the ruling doesn't ban the president from trying again to do away with DACA, so the only solution for around 700,000 program beneficiaries is for Congress to legalize their stay in the United States, the advocates said.
