Officers decked out in riot gear made at least three arrests as firefighters rushed to put out the blazes.

Over 100 people protested Saturday night in Milwaukee in demonstrations that turned violent.

The 23-year-old man killed by police and another suspect ditched a car and ran after the stop at N. 44th St. and W. Auer Ave, investigators said.

Milwaukee police said at least one officer was hospitalized and three squad cars sustained damage during the violent protests Saturday night.
