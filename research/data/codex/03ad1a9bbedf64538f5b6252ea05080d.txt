During one scuffle, one protester was pulled to the ground and was arrested by police.Protesters are calling for Emanuel and Alvarez to resign. They say city government has failed the African American community."Yes, we got McCarthy out of office. Anita is next, and Rahm is next," said protester Lamon Reccord. "So you think you're going to fight all these people, you're still not getting our vote. Because we're not going to forget the $200 million budget cuts you had in CPS, we're not going to forget the 50 schools you closed down, the 4,500 staff layoffs in CPS, we're not going to forget about the communities you refuse to serve with justice and needing attention. We're not going to forget about that."On Monday night, at least 50 people poured into the intersection of 53rd and King Drive, the site of Johnson's fatal shooting, for a rally and march called "Chicago for Ronnie Man," titled for Johnson's nickname.Dorothy Holmes, Johnson's mother, blasted Alvarez at the demonstration, saying: "And Anita Alvarez, she can go with them, too. Because she's still covering up this murder."Another demonstration is planned at CPD headquarters on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Related topics:loopprotestchicago city hallrahm emanuelShare:ShareTweetEmailCopyright © 2020 WLS-TV.
