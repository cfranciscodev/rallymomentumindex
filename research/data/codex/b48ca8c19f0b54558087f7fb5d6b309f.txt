"It's time for new people to be in office. It's time for new people to take the helm and to protect people who are marginalized and on the fringes," he said in an interview before the rally. "As you can see, new fringes are being created every day." Saturday's event - scheduled immediately after an earlier protest targeting the so-called "sanctuary cities" law - started at Discovery Green before the group of more than 150 marchers set off down Walker. UGLY RESPONSE: Congressman gets death threats after call for Trump's impeachment Waving signs and holding banners, protesters shouted, "This is what democracy looks like," and, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, killer cops have got to go." The gathering aimed to promote solidarity, support human rights and target police brutality. "Today is the march for human rights," Woods said. "Every community that you can think of has come under attack, so this event is a solidarity event." A strong police presence escorted the crowd through the street as protesters set off for City Hall around 5:30 p.m. UNUSUAL SUPPORT: 'Babes for Trump 2020' gearing up for political fight "It's not about Donald Trump, you can impeach him all day," Woods told the crowd from the steps of City Hall. "But they got a bunch of Donald Trumps right here in Houston. So I've decided to raise hell in City Council." He went on to slam the city's new ordinances targeting homelessness and panhandling and then vowed to "dismantle the f--- out of the system." After revving up the crowd, Woods introduced a new crop of local organizers, including Bobbie Hoskins. "What I'm really passionate about is community involvement," she told the crowd. "We can come out and we can rally and we can march and we can stand in solidarity and that is all necessary as well, but what we need to do is do some groundwork and get into the communities." Another new voice in the local movement was Chris Malone, who spoke about solidarity and black lives. "I'm black, I'm gay, and I'm afraid," he said. "And I'm pissed the f--- off." A number of other speakers took the megaphone and aired their concerns for the community, all while the crowd roared its support. When the gathering finally broke up before 7 p.m., the protesters dispersed peacefully as police looked on.
