Campaigners carried placards before staging a protest in High Street and walking to Steelhouse Lane police station on Saturday afternoon. It was sparked by the killing of two black men in the United States.

"We're not taking it any more.” Those who took part said trams were stopped and bus passengers jumped off their services to join in as campaigners linked up with another protest into the deaths of Kingsley Burrell and Mark Duggan .

An inquest later concluded that "neglect and delays by health staff with prolonged restraint by police” contributed to his death. Mr Duggan was 29 when he was shot dead by police in London in August 2011. After Saturday's event, a message on the Artivist UK website said volunteers were working on an official Black Lives Matter Birmingham chapter. In London, a 300-strong crowd brought Brixton to a standstill as a crowd chanting "black lives matter” and "hands up, don't shoot” took to the street. It followed a protest in central London on Friday. There was an outpouring of anger across America in the wake of the death of Alton Sterling, 37, who was shot dead by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last Tuesday. The following day, tensions rose further still with the killing of 32-year-old Philando Castile in Minnesota during a police traffic stop. His death was shown live on Facebook as his girlfriend filmed the incident on her phone. On Thursday evening Micah Johnson, 25, opened fire on police officers monitoring a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, Texas, killing five and injuring seven more. The unrest continued on Sunday night when dozens of people were arrested in Baton Rouge at a new protest. Police officers faced down hundreds of demonstrators near a ramp leading to an interstate highway before another squad in riot gear arrived and took dozens into custody. Earlier on Sunday, some 2,000 protesters rallied outside the Capitol building, State Police Major Doug Cain said.birmingham.liveFollow @birmingham_liveCommentsShow more commentsMore OnFacebookQueen Elizabeth HospitalThe QueenBirmingham City Centre NewsallMost ReadMost RecentBirmingham AirportRyanair, Easyjet, TUI, Jet2 announce big updates over summer holidays in 2020 -
