(KKTV) - Two women protesting the De'Von Bailey shooting briefly interrupted the Festival of Lights Parade Saturday evening by lying down in the middle of the parade route. Police say the women refused to get up when ordered to, stopping the parade for about five minutes while officers dealt with the situation. "After given a lawful order to move by officers, they refused and were subsequently arrested. They had to be carried out of the parade route by officers," the police department wrote in a blotter entry about the incident. The parade resumed after the street was cleared. The two women were taken to a police station and cited with obstructing passage or assembly and resistance/interference with public official. They were then released. Police identified the protesters as Tyescha Clark and Flannery Burdick. The incident happened on Tejon Avenue just south of Colorado Avenue about 25 minutes after the parade started. The controversial Aug. 3 shooting of 19-year-old Bailey has sparked numerous protests in the weeks and months since. A grand jury found the officers involved in the shooting justified, a result an attorney for the Bailey family called "tainted" by lack of an independent investigation.
