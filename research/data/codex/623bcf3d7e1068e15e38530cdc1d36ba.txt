By Kate Jacobson and By Kate Jacobson Sun Sentinel | Dec 06, 2014 | 8:27 PM | FORT LAUDERDALE About 100 protesters blocked traffic in downtown Ft. Lauderdale. The protest was a part of a national response to the police-involved deaths of unarmed black men in New York and Ferguson. Linked arm in arm, about a hundred people stood in a line and answered the honking car horns coming from all directions. "If traffic moves, we shut it down!" one woman screamed. The crowd of protesters moved in tighter, blocking off traffic and chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot!"

It is part of a national response to the recent grand jury decisions in the police-involved deaths of unarmed black men in New York and Ferguson, Mo. Protesters blocked off sections of Broward Boulevard, U.S. 1 and Las Olas Boulevard, forcing traffic to come to a halt and, at times, causing tension with passers-by.

It's our right to protest, so that's what we came to do." [Popular on SunSentinel.com] 2020 Beach Guide: Fort Lauderdale beach » Williams said she posted about her idea to protest on Facebook at 8:30 a.m. Saturday, and by 5 p.m., more than 100 people joined her. It is the latest protest to happen after a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a while police officer for fatally shooting Michael Brown, an unarmed black suspect, and after a New York City grand jury decision to not charge a white police officer who killed Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, with a chokehold. During Fort Lauderdale's demonstration, tensions arose when the group moved toward Las Olas. One woman ran though the protesters, grabbed their signs and used racial slurs toward them. Others yelled out that Brown and Garner deserved to die. "This is bull," said Terra Ashmore, who was visiting Fort Lauderdale from Estero, Fla. "I don't want to see this while I'm on vacation. What's going on [in Ferguson and New York], it doesn't affect us."

I agree with [the protesters]."
