This is why we disrupt. pic.twitter.com/8L8golSUZy— Sharmin Ultra (@sharminultraa) January 4, 2015 "Every 28 hours, a black person in America is killed by the police,” the protesters said. "These are our brothers and sisters. Today and every day, we honor their lives.” Another restaurant: we interrupt your brunch to honor the names of victims of police brutality. #blackbrunchnyc pic.twitter.com/k1W3YzYgMF— Sharmin Ultra (@sharminultraa) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc is the opposite of breakfast at tiffanys. #blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/Rd2zxLqrNJ— Naima Pepper (@hafrocentric) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc at Lallisse on Lexington. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/EfaXbm9eOG— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Black women killed by police: Rekiya Boyd, Renisha McBride, Shaniqua Proctor. #blackbrunchnyc #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/6Zgj3VTCcb— Sharmin Ultra (@sharminultraa) January 4, 2015 There were no immediate reports of arrests, and the protests were said to be largely peaceful — though there were reports of verbal clashes with brunchgoers and waitstaff. The manager at Resto NYC tried to literally push one of our comrades in order to push us out. We did not move.— jovitasmagnolia (@JovaLynne) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc at Penelope. Some stood, some grabbed arms and screamed in our faces. We know which side you're on. pic.twitter.com/tA9BTRJCqi— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Others appeared to show solidarity with the demonstrators. We're asking brunchgoers to STAND for black life. A good number in the last spot stood or raised their fists. #blackbrunchnyc #BlackBrunch— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Hella folks stood up for black lives at Lungomare. #BlackBrunch #oakland pic.twitter.com/ZmmNa5Ja8P— BGD (@BlackGirlDanger) January 4, 2015 #BlackBrunch protesters entering Oak restaurants 2 read names of dead.

How dare folks go out for an omelette with friends and family on a Sunday! #blackbrunchnyc #BlackBrunch— Ted (@TBillsss) January 4, 2015 #BlackBrunch might have worked better if it wasn't in January. A lot of white people are dieting right now and just had quinoa at home.— Yale Cohn (@YaleCohn) January 4, 2015 I find #BlackBrunch to be hilarious. They're targeting urban liberals, alienating potential allies.Didn't think this through, did you?— Bob Owens (@bob_owens) January 4, 2015 ReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextFormer White House Ethics Chief Reveals 'Disturbing' Ivanka Trump EmailsHuffPostTrump brags he 'made Juneteenth very famous' despite learning about it just last weekYahoo NewsDisclosure: behind Laverne Cox's Netflix documentary on trans representationThe GuardianAtlanta Police Officers Call Out Of Work After Officers Charged In Rayshard Brooks CaseHuffPostHow Lady Gaga gave the jacket off her back to a fan who complimented herTODAYTrump lashes out at 'sick puppy' Bolton for devastating White House memoirYahoo NewsU.S. grapples with new virus infections: Younger patients, more cases, but fewer deathsYahoo News VideoPeople On TikTok Are Spinning Their Peanut Butter To Make It Look Like A New JarDelishTrump Rips Supreme Court Ruling That Saves DACA: 'Shotgun Blasts Into The Face'HuffPostOfficer in video complaining about fast-food order says people missed the pointNBC NewsSupreme Court Rules Trump Wrongly Ended DACA, Leaves Program In PlaceHuffPostPelosi says portraits of 4 Confederate House speakers will be removed from the CapitolYahoo News VideoThe Smurfs Reboot: New Animated Series Ordered at NickelodeonTVLine.comFBI arrests Texas man for racist video threat to kill 'at least 200' Black Lives Matter protestersUSA TODAYGOP Sheriff Who Refused To Enforce Coronavirus Lockdown Tests Positive At White HouseHuffPostTrump's Midnight Twitter Rant Against John Bolton Backfires SpectacularlyHuffPostSCOTUS rejects Trump's effort to end legal protections for 'Dreamers'Yahoo News VideoReview: String quartet with Yo-Yo Ma wows again on 2nd albumAssociated PressComedian Chris D'Elia accused of sexual harassment, 'predatory' behaviorYahoo Celebrity
