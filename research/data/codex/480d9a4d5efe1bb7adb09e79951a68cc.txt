(Autumn Johnson/Patch) DANVILLE, CA — Dozens of peaceful protesters gathered Wednesday in downtown Danville, for the second day in a row. Protesters calling for racial justice lined up along San Ramon Valley Boulevard, near the street's intersection with Railroad Avenue. Cars passing by honked in support. Several Danville police units were stationed nearby to monitor the protest. Wednesday's demonstration was held in the same spot where protesters gathered the day before in honor of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, who died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, a 44-year-old white man, knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin pinned Floyd down after arresting him following a call reporting his suspected use of a counterfeit bill at a store. Floyd said he could not breathe during the encounter and had no pulse when he was taken into an ambulance. On Tuesday demonstrators held signs that read, "Black lives matter," "I stand with you," "No justice, no peace" and "Justice for George Floyd," a video posted by Danville Social shows. Downtown Danville businesses were boarded up after police warned of looting threats directed at the town on social media. The posts were especially concerning after looters struck Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek Sunday evening. No looting was associated with Danville's protests. A protest in nearby San Ramon was slated for 5 p.m. Wednesday. City Center Bishop Ranch and other local businesses, including Target were boarded up.
