It's something called diplomacy. It's something called, you know, 'outsmart your opponent.' It's called, 'get them to do the thing that you want them to do, and have them think it was their idea.' It's called, 'Quit f___ing with the lives of millions and millions of people.'"More: Pilgrimage Festival goers overall 'pleased,' but with some feedbackThe packed field on Harlinsdale Farm roared in approval."All right," Vedder added. "Now that I think that we've gotten that out of the way, I think it's gonna be a great night."Vedder's solo set had its share of non-partisan highlights, too. That included an appearance from Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron, who unfortunately didn't have a drumkit handy, but joined in for a few vocal harmonies.He also brought out a teenage fan named Jack West, who'd caught Vedder's attention just hours before on the festival grounds. West's vocal performance blew the crowd away."He's just a really cool kid,” Vedder enthused.He also marveled at his crowd, which didn't budge through his encore."It looks like there's people all the way out to the highway, and that's a lot of people to see a guy with a mandolin.
