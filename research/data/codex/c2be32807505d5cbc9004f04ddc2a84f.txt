This time around, protesters were not just demonstrating to continue the legacy of Dr. King, but to show solidarity with Julius Jones, Robert Blackwell Gibbs, Kevin Ksen and Sonya Conner, the four who were arrested last January. The latter two attended the most recent protest. "We stand here in solidarity with the Kelley Square Four,” Alex Rothfelder said. "... we need to stand against oppression and let people speak their minds.” Rothfelder and others were also representing a political movement, called by various names, but all leaning toward socialism, with Socialist Alternative one of the more well-represented groups. Among the goals of the protesters, besides justice for the Kelley Square Four, were free education, a $15 minimum wage, an end to the school to prison pipeline and an end to racist policing. And in response to "the racism of this police department, who refuse to be investigated,” protesters called for a democratically elected civilian review board with the power to hire and fire police officers. The protest could not have come at a worse time for the police in Worcester, as just hours before, community activist Chris Horton, who is in his 70s, was thrown to the ground before being arrested at the Martin Luther King Jr. Day Breakfast at Quinsigamond Community College. Worcester Police referred questions Horton's arrest for assaulting a police officer and his subsequent hospitalization to QCC police, who said in a statement that they were assisted in the arrest by the WPD. "This is why we're here now,” Conner said. "Because police terrorism and brutality are happening here today ... Chris Horton was targeted.” Sign up for daily e-mails Sign up Site ServicesSupport Local BusinessesStaff DirectorySubscriptionsCalendarMarketplaceT&GLegal NoticesBusiness DirectoryAdvertise with UsPay Your Ad BillStay ConnectedFacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestRSS FeedsUnity Radio HourRegional Publicationsbaystateparent magazineLeominster ChampionMillbury-Sutton ChronicleThe Grafton NewsThe Landmark © Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.
