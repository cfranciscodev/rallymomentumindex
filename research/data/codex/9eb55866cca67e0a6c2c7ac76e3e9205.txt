"In this case it was an unarmed black man in which from everything we see was not posing a threat to police,” said protester Eric Verlo. On Friday afternoon, Naeschylus Vinzant, 37, a parole absconder with a violent, lengthy criminal history, was shot once in the chest and killed on an Aurora street. He was not armed, police said. Police have said little about the case. But Vinzant had removed his Colorado Department of Corrections ankle monitor March 2. Lenicia Butler, the mother of some of Vinzant's children, demanded that police tell the family why the officer shot Vinzant. "They don't get to say when someone's story comes to an end,” Butler said, adding that Vinzant left behind seven children. "He just had a 2-month-old baby. He has two sons that have to grow up wondering whether they're safe in society.” Earlier Wednesday, new Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz said police have not released much information because they still have yet to interview the officer, who has not been identified. The officer has obtained a lawyer, which has slowed the investigation, Metz said. "Not much has changed,” Metz said. "We are still awaiting the officer's statement.” Metz said about 30 cops responded to the 16200 block of East 12th Avenue at 1:15 p.m. Friday. He would not say why the officer fired on Vinzant. Wednesday's protest, organized by Aurora Cop Watch, was at the intersection of East Alameda Avenue and Sable Boulevard. Protesters chanted the refrain that has become common during recent police protests nationwide, "Hands up, don't shoot.” Several held signs that demanded justice. The protest was peaceful, and there were no police officers in sight. "We want to let the new police chief know this is unacceptable,” said activist Shareef Aleem of Aurora Cop Watch. "Every life has to matter.” Metz, on the job less than two weeks, has promised a transparent investigation into the fatal shooting. But protesters say it has taken too long for the Aurora Police Department to provide the community with answers. One of those in attendance was Jeffery Washington, who is running for an at-large seat on the Denver City Council. Washington told The Denver Post that the community needs to have patience as it awaits all the facts. He said he feels for the family of the man who died as well as the police officer who shot Vinzant. "I hope this doesn't turn into mob justice,” Washington said. "Two people's lives were affected, two families' lives that will never be the same.” One of Vinzant's sons, Grayland Carter, 9, kept a brave face and he spoke to the media who had gathering around him and his siblings. "He didn't live the life he wanted to, but he was a good man,” said the boy, who like other family members was wearing a yellow T-shirt with Vinzant's picture on it.
