When protesters stopped in front of the Hampton Coliseum at the end of an anti-Trump march that stretched down West Mercury Boulevard, a truck drove by, waving a confederate flag. A passenger yelled obscenities about the "black lives matter" movement. About 20 people march in Hampton for a peaceful anti-Trump protest Thursday. But in the crowd, a person yelled: "We love you too, bro!" Advertisement About 20 people marched down West Mercury Boulevard in Hampton Thursday night, ending in the Coliseum, to protest the president-elect. But unlike other national rallies, this one took a positive tone. Advertisement One man came by to drop off water. Another woman exclaimed she'd hit her 10,000 step count on her pedometer. Behind the protesters, police cars trailed them, shutting down the streets and tweeting from the Hampton Police Twitter, so the protesters could speak and be safe. "That's what we're here for, to protect the First Amendment," said Hampton Police Spokesman Jason Price. The police division knew about the protest and worked with the group to plan it. When a pedestrian was struck by a car down the street before the protest, officers asked the protestors to wait 20 minutes, and they did. "People see protesters as animals," said Japharii Jones, who helped organize the march. "We were showing them that we can do it without ignorance and we can do it without violence." The group and Hampton police worked just as well together when they marched in July, he said. This time, people in the group encouraged each other to attend local school board and city council meetings. At the end of the protest, people exchanged numbers and Instagram usernames, and walked each other back to their cars. "We have to stand up with our own locally before we can take it to the state in Richmond or nationally," Jones said. He said the group plans to march in Washington during the inauguration.
