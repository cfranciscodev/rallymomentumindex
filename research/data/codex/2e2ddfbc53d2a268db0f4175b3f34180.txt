LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) - A wild array of misconceptions is why Parkway North High School principal Jenny Marquart is speaking out. It's all because of a group of pictures circulating across social media of Parkway North High school teachers holding signs that say, "Black lives matter." Once the pictures hit twitter the rumors started to swirl on the internet. Online critics are posting everything from accusing the teachers of political posturing to kids being withdrawn from the school. Principal Marquart says none of the rumors are true. "They really don't know the teachers they don't know the students they don't know our school they are making of assumptions and some of them very negative. I don't think that there was every any intention that teachers were taking a stand of some sort of another. I have talked to parents about these students about this." she said Officials say the pictures were intended to show support for students after they asked to have discussions about Ferguson and race issues in the region. Students were free to express their thoughts. At this point students can have discussions at anytime. Most of them taking place in English and Social Studies classes. In the end teachers say the talks have been fruitful and beneficial to those who participate. All of the signs are stored in the classrooms. Pnh teachers in support of Black Lives Matter.

LOUIS - Missouri's unemployment rate went down a tenth of a percentage point from April to May. A news release from the Missouri Department of Economic Development said following the state's tremendous job losses in April, the labor market began to bounce back in May.

(KDVR) -- The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked the state to reduce health restrictions for a Colorado meat production facility that suffered one of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the state, emails suggest. In an April 11 exchange, Jill Hunsaker Ryan, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), said she would consider less restrictive health guidelines for the JBS meat production plant in Greeley despite a joint public health order she helped to issue the previous day asking for the immediate closure of the facility.

The high court's 5-4 decision only voids president Trump's 2017 attempt to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But the ruling doesn't ban the president from trying again to do away with DACA, so the only solution for around 700,000 program beneficiaries is for Congress to legalize their stay in the United States, the advocates said.
