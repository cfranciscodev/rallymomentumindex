(KNWA) ‚Äî A protest and candlelight vigil was held Wednesday evening outside the Fort Smith Police Department in the wake of a recent officer-involved shooting. Dozens of protesters marched up and down Garrison Avenue and stood outside the Fort Smith Police Department. The protest was over the death of 27-year-old Samuel Morris, who police say they shot when they found him holding a woman hostage at knifepoint this past weekend. Many of the protesters are family members of Morris. Police released audio of the fatal officer-involved shooting. Police responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex on Johnson Street when they found 27-year-old Samuel Morris holding a woman hostage with a knife. The department said Morris refused to drop the knife, forcing officers to open fire. The following is said during the recording: Victim ‚Äì "Please!

The audio is graphic and may be considered disturbing. Department officials said it released the audio to provide a better understanding of the incident surrounding the investigation. Just after the shooting, police promised to be as transparent as possible. The officer involved is on paid administrative leave during the investigation. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
