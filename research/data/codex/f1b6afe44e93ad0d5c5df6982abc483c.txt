The peaceful protest was organised by Marta Sophie Kempinska, so people could come together and show solidarity with the black community. Attendees currently gathering are being asked to stand within social distancing squares marked out on the floor, with many also wearing masks and other PPE. Signs have also been produced asking people to respect social distancing guidelines, as well as stating "Pro black isn't anti white", and "I'm not black but I see you, I hear you, I mourn with you, I will fight for you", among others. The demonstration is in solidarity with protests around the world, which were sparked by the murder of George Floyd in the US on May 25.

I am enraged, I am emotional and passionate about standing in solidarity with the Black Community and speaking up about the issues surrounding discriminatory systemic injustice and racism. This is a time for black voices to be heard and direct action to be taken."However my conscious was torn because I am aware that millions of lives have been put at risk and lost because of this yet because of my voluntary roles, attending the protests could put hundreds of vulnerable peoples lives at risk of COVID-19. So, I reached out to people in my local community, the local media and personal political contacts about advice on how we can help without putting anyone at risk by attending the protests. Sadly I received a shocking response from one of my contacts who is an MP saying 'Given this is an issue for the US, I am not really sure why we think it is our business to comment on internal US matters...countries around the world need to be very careful not to interfere with their internal matters.'"My response to this politician is this, 'if it were not for other countries interfering with internal matters in the 1940s then me and my community would not be alive today. Maybe if racism, violent discrimination, injustice and oppression to black communities had been treated fairly, supported, educated about and given the same protections years ago under the law then change may have occurred in the US and people like George Floyd would still be alive today. If the people in power who can actually make these changes do nothing then the public must speak up and put pressure on them. I believe if you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.'"America should be held higher to account as a democracy and world leader who we trade with! It is a country those who are oppressed should be looking up to for hope. The movement for Reform Judaism message is the Torah (Old Testament) teaches 'do not stand idly by the spilled blood of your neighbour..love your neighbour as yourself.' Reform Judaism supports Black communities in the US, the UK and globally in asserting their right to live with the same protections and opportunities as every other group. The death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer is deeply troubling and we recognise the pain of those protesting against systemic injustice. We stand by Black Communities and Black members of our communities and commit to non-violent challenges to all injustice. It is our duty to do this, not just now, but consistently, if we are to do our part to repair our world. Black Lives Matter.' I am sorry the world is only now waking up to your suffering which has been happening for so many generations."As Senator Kamala Harris stated 'You should not be subjected to the indignity of being told to get on your knees and put your hands on your head, simply because you are walking while Black and it is happening every day in America'. Nor should you be shot 8 times as you lay in bed like Breonna Taylor as the police were at the wrong house to begin with. As shocking as these high profile examples are, they represent the tip of the iceberg of persistent racial inequalities that constitute a crisis for public health. I want to be unapologetic for being another voice in Black Lives Matter and if you are tired of hearing about racism, just imagine how tired some people are of experiencing it.”16:05Watch: Protesters
