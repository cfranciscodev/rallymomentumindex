Events have been taking place across the globe after the latest movement, which was sparked by the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd by a white police officer in Minnesota on May 25, spread from US cities to the rest of the world. Footage of the killing went viral, causing dismay at the sight of yet another case of brutal violence against black people being shared widely online. Protests started in cities across America, many of which sadly turned violent with property destroyed and dangerous clashes between police and protesters. But most events have remained peaceful, including the thousands of people who attended Hyde Park in London on Wednesday to show solidarity with black and minority ethnic communities. Now a gathering has also been planned for Hull and is set to take place outside the city hall, in Queen Victoria Square, on Thursday, June 4 at 3pm. The city hall will also be illuminated in purple light in a show of solidarity against racism on Wednesday evening.

Miss Kempinska, 24, a final year mental health nursing student, said: "We just want to support the black community and show that we stand with them. "We're all aware of what's happened, but it's been happening for so many years, it's not just one case and it's not just in the US and we want to shed a light on that. "It's time we used our privilege to speak up because that hasn't happened so far and it's sparked something in me that's said I should be speaking up."

But she said they were acutely aware of the need to be as safe as possible while protesting during the Covid-19 pandemic and had liaised with police about the plans. She said organisers hoped to put down floor markings to keep people at least two metres apart and encouraged anyone bringing banners or placards to write "2m" on the back. Wearing masks and gloves has also been encouraged and Marta said she would bring gloves to give out to people that did not have them. She also plans to gather as many contact details as possible from people attending in case the track and trace system is required should anyone fall ill after the event.

They said: "We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. "We are also appalled to see the violence and damage that has happened in so many US cities since then. Our hearts go out to all those affected by these terrible events and hope that peace and order will soon be restored. "In the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary. We strive to continuously learn and improve. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it. "Policing is complex and challenging and sometimes we fall short. When we do, we are not afraid to shine a light on injustices or to be held to account. Find the latest news for your area "The relationship between the police and the public in the UK is strong but there is always more to do. Every day, up and down the country, officers and staff are working to strengthen those relationships and address concerns. Only by working closely with our communities do we build trust and help keep people safe. "We know people want to make their voices heard. The right to lawful protest is key part of any democracy, which UK police uphold and facilitate. "But coronavirus remains a deadly disease and there are still restrictions in place to prevent its spread, which include not gathering outside in groups of more than six people. So for whatever reason people want to come together, we ask that people continue to work with officers at this challenging time."HullLiveFollow @HullLiveMore OnHull City CentreBlack Communities NewsallMost ReadMost RecentCoronavirusFoul-mouthed worker at coronavirus testing site leaves woman 'dumbstruck'Catherine Heckford-Dickinson, 45, was shocked by the staff member's reactionBody found on East Yorkshire beach identified as missing womanMissing peopleAlison Danks went missing from her home in MayShocking moment man 'spits' at woman and kicks bus doors after face mask rowStagecoachThe incident occurred on the number 11 Stagecoach bus on Tuesday eveningDark history of former Hull mayor causes concern over park statueHull City CouncilThe memorial of former Mayor of Hull Zachariah Pearson 'could cause offence'KCOM announce cheapest Lightstream broadband yet to new customersKCOMIt comes as it moves into territories where it will compete with other internet service providersUK & World NewsNew rules for hairdressers include no small talkThere are also new rules on wearing coats to a salon and how to leave a tipBank lists most common scams committed by fraudsters during coronavirus pandemicUK & World NewsFake deals offering Nintendo Switches, pedigree dogs and hot tubs for sale are rife with more people shopping onlineDeals to allow foreign holidays will be done within daysUK & World News"We want to open up as soon as we safely and responsibly can and we will look at all the mechanisms to do so"Domino's tests new vegan-friendly pizza dough after fans' verdict on earlier versionFood & DrinkNew Vegan Margherita and Vegan Vegi Supreme will use the improved dough and be trialled at 46 stores nationwideNew rules for cinemas as they make plans to reopenUK & World NewsGoing to watch a movie will be a very different experienceMost ReadMost RecentCoronavirusFoul-mouthed worker at coronavirus testing site leaves woman 'dumbstruck'Catherine Heckford-Dickinson, 45, was shocked by the staff member's reactionBody found on East Yorkshire beach identified as missing womanMissing peopleAlison Danks went missing from her home in MayShocking moment man 'spits' at woman and kicks bus doors after face mask rowStagecoachThe incident occurred on the number 11 Stagecoach bus on Tuesday eveningDark history of former Hull mayor causes concern over park statueHull City CouncilThe memorial of former Mayor of Hull Zachariah Pearson 'could cause offence'Former East Yorkshire charity ambassador to be sentenced for stealing £50,000 from employerHull Crown CourtRichard Fell will appear at Hull Crown Court in JulyUK & World NewsNew rules for hairdressers include no small talkThere are also new rules on wearing coats to a salon and how to leave a tipBank lists most common scams committed by fraudsters during coronavirus pandemicUK & World NewsFake deals offering Nintendo Switches, pedigree dogs and hot tubs for sale are rife with more people shopping onlineDeals to allow foreign holidays will be done within daysUK & World News"We want to open up as soon as we safely and responsibly can and we will look at all the mechanisms to do so"Domino's tests new vegan-friendly pizza dough after fans' verdict on earlier versionFood & DrinkNew Vegan Margherita and Vegan Vegi Supreme will use the improved dough and be trialled at 46 stores nationwideNew rules for cinemas as they make plans to reopenUK & World NewsGoing to watch a movie will be a very different experience Top StoriesShocking moment man 'spits' at woman and kicks bus doors after face mask rowStagecoachThe incident occurred on the number 11 Stagecoach bus on Tuesday eveningWidow 'will not rest' after blaming 'lockdown delays' for wife's coronavirus deathCoronavirusJulie Taylor-Broadbent, 49, died of coronavirus before being able to meet her new grandsonCoronavirus live UK updates as treatment rolled out, pubs plan, hairdresser rules and foreign holidays deal 'close'CoronavirusA commonly-used steroid reduced coronavirus deaths by a third, research has revealedBody found on East Yorkshire beach identified as missing womanMissing peopleAlison Danks went missing from her home in MayHull man charged with 'encouraging terrorism' after police raid Cheadle Close homeTerrorismHe is due to appear in court on ThursdayBransholme pensioner leaves Stagecoach bus after one stop as passengers board without masksStagecoachStagecoach said it is 'ultimately' the responsibility of police to enforce the rulesNew rules for cinemas as they make plans to reopenUK & World NewsGoing to watch a movie will be a very different experienceDerby wins and international drubbings -
