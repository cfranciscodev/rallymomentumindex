One of the protests lasted well into the morning. By early May 18 at 5th and Denver, it was much quieter, but a few hours earlier, protesters blocked the streets and police were out trying to get them to calm down. Special Coverage: Terence Crutcher Police ShootingThe protests eventually moved to the sidewalks, where several conversations broke out between people on both sides.News On 6 heard one man say he thought justice was served and that Betty Shelby was rightfully acquitted.But we heard others say Shelby was found not guilty because she's a cop and thinks she might be above the law.We talked to people on both sides about how everyone responded. "Sometimes, change comes from starting the conversation," said Black Lives Matter OKC Exec. Director T Sheri Dickerson. But others said the streets of Tulsa isn't the place for the protests."Talk about it on Facebook or somewhere else. Just not on the street. You don't have to block traffic," said Brandon Henson.We asked police dispatchers if they had any arrests but they say they're not sure.
