"Our objective was to be heard and seen,” said Tanashia Lynch, one of the organizers, who graduated in May from Lincoln High School in the Sunset District. "We saw what was happening in the rest of our nation and decided, 'Let's do something.'” The marchers briefly blocked the entrances to Westfield shopping mall and other shops near Powell and Market streets. For more than an hour, protesters were clustered on the Fremont Street off-ramp from the Bay Bridge in a sometimes tense standoff with police, after on-ramps from Essex and Bryant streets were closed briefly as well. At the peak, roughly 500 people were marching down Third Street past Moscone Center amid gridlocked cars while chanting, "Black Lives Matter” and "Hey hey, ho ho, these killer cops have got to go.” But it began much smaller, with perhaps 100 mostly young protesters near the Hall of Justice. They had wanted to close down Interstate 80 by charging up the off-ramps near the Hall of Justice. But that idea had been announced in the social media messages spreading word of the planned protest, so police were out in force. Instead, protesters blocked the intersection of Fifth and Bryant streets while lines of police stood on the on-ramp, with seven motorcycles end to end as a barrier. Most of the protesters were young and African American, but not all. "What I see here are that people are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” said Valerie Tulier-Laiwa of Daly City, who grew up in the Mission District. "Their purpose is to make other people hear the message, and the way to do that is to make them feel discomfort.” Watching the standoff were older men and women standing in line at the homeless shelter at Fifth and Bryant, the city's largest. Some raised a fist, but none left their place in line.

The most combative moments were at the ramp standoffs at Fremont and Essex streets, with brief scuffles where at least one police officer raised a baton before protesters intervened between the police and other marchers. Some shouted obscenities into the faces of police, or chanted, "How do you spell murder? SFPD!” More often the mood was celebratory: "Look at how much attention we got,” one organizer told protesters as they blocked Market Street near the cable car turnaround. "Give the person next to you a hug.” The Fremont Street ramp closure ended at 6:15 p.m. after police ordered the crowd to disperse. Those remaining then marched through the Financial District to Justin Herman Plaza. "This is not where it ends,” Hezekiah Walker, a student at San Francisco State University, told others as they prepared to disperse. "This is where it starts.” John King and Kevin Schultz are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.
