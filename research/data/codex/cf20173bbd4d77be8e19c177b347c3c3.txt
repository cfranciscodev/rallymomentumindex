The demonstration, which began around 7 p.m. at 14th Street and Broadway, was one of several events around the Bay Area timed to coincide with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. There was a large police presence as the crowd marched north on Broadway and Telegraph. The crowd then circled back into the downtown area. By 9 p.m., the crowd dwindled to about 15 to 20 people, marching south around Lake Merritt and onto International Boulevard. Police issued a crowd dispersal order, then started to arrest people for obstructing International. It was unclear how many were arrested Sunday night. A small knot of demonstrators continued marching east on International well into the night. As of 9:30 p.m., however, there had been none of the violence or vandalism that marred recent other demonstrations in the East Bay. Around 10 p.m., Fruitvale BART Station was closed due to a civil disturbance, said the transit agency. The march was at times tense. Some marchers repeatedly taunted the police, in some cases yelling within inches of officers' faces, "You ain't s—! You mother—s think you're helping, but you're killing our kids.” Two marchers carried a banner proclaiming, "Gentrification is violence.” Other demonstrators, however, were trying not to be confrontational. At one point when the demonstration passed under a freeway underpass, and some in the crowd started screaming, "Let's take it,” others urged them not to try to block the freeway. The demonstration included people from across the Bay Area and all races. Related Stories Martin Luther King Jr. Day carries on the dream "I'm here to support the black community,” said one Berkeley resident who gave only his first name, Brennos. "I'd like the local government and the national government to do something about the disparities in the way black people are treated. The best way to do that right now is coming out into the streets, because they don't seem to be listening.” A marcher from Alameda who gave her name as Chris said she thought King would approve. "I think he'd be happy to see the young people here speaking up for themselves and defending themselves.” Earlier Sunday, 50 demonstrators gathered at the Walmart on Edgewater Drive near the O.co Coliseum to voice frustrations with the retail giant and to remember unarmed black men killed by police around the country. Billy Garner said his cousin, Billy Vaughn, was shot and killed by Oakland police in December 1999. On Sunday, the 25-year-old held his late family member's photo as he stood in the Walmart parking lot. While Garner did not elaborate on the circumstances of his cousin's death, he said the killing was emblematic of what he sees as a larger issue of police violence against young black men throughout the country. "It changed how I felt about law enforcement,” he said about the shooting. "This situation hit close to me. I feel like because he was black he was killed.” Organizers chose Walmart as a backdrop for Sunday's action to call attention to the Aug. 5 death of 22-year-old John Crawford, who was shot by police in an Ohio Walmart while he held an air rifle he had taken off a store shelf. "Not only is Walmart the site of the killing of an unarmed black man, but it's also a site of perpetual economic violence,” said 23-year-old Lucas Solorzano, who led the crowd in a series of chants before the group staged a "die-in” in the parking lot. Protesters called out Walmart for what they see as meager pay for employees, and the blocking of workers from unionizing. "Poverty is violence,” Solorzano said to the crowd. "Let's take Dr. Martin Luther King's call for justice seriously. Let's organize. Let's shut it down.” Later Sunday afternoon, demonstrators, many of them families with children, marched in Emeryville and vowed to shut down "business as usual” at the Bay Street mall. Others staged a moment of silence in a Whole Foods in Berkeley. As dusk fell in San Francisco, demonstrators gathered at the Powell Street cable car turnaround for a "sleep-in” to protest laws they said do nothing but target the poor. They took particular aim at San Francisco's ban on sleeping in public, saying the homeless have a fundamental "right to rest.” To make their point, they brought blankets and coffee for a long night on the pavement, in the heart of San Francisco's main shopping district. "If you think it's wrong to criminalize people for sleeping on the street, give me a 'Hell, yeah!'” said human rights organizer Bilal Ali to the crowd of perhaps 50 demonstrators, as shoppers and tourists stopped to snap photos. "We say housing, not handcuffs. ... If Dr. King were alive today, he'd be right here with us.” Sunday's demonstrations followed several protests Saturday where marchers blocked traffic in Oakland and San Francisco. More than 100 people, many chanting "Black lives matter,” converged on the Oakland Police Department's Eastmont substation at 2651 73rd Ave. after gathering at the Fruitvale BART Station. Four people were arrested during Saturday's march, according to reports, after the mostly peaceful crowd advanced through the streets around 4 p.m. By 7 p.m. the protest had ended, according to Oakland police. In San Francisco, a large crowd of demonstrators, many from the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, amassed at 18th and Castro streets around 8 p.m. Saturday and shut down traffic in the heart of the district for two hours.
