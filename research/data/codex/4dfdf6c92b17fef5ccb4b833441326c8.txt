The Justice Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime.More than 100 people attended the vigil, organized by MU students with help from the African-American Clergy Coalition of Mid-Missouri, to mourn and express their feelings through prayers, songs and poems."It seems like we do this too often,” MU senior Ayanna Poole said, her voice breaking, before reading her original poem. "I'm hurting. I couldn't even sit down to write poetry today — everything I'm about to say is a rant. I'm so tired of the same thing over and over again and sitting here crying every time. I break down every single time. It's exhausting. But I can't stop fighting, and I won't stop fighting. I've been fighting my entire life.”A sign reading, "#BlackLivesMatter” was displayed with the nine victims' names around the slogan, along with photographs of each of those killed."We've got to let the neighborhood know that we're not going to stand back and just let this keep on going,” said Bishop Lorenzo Lawson of Chosen Generation Ministries. "So we need to come together and overcome this evil with good. It's going to take all of us. We can't just come here tonight and then go our separate ways and let this stuff continue to go. We've got to come together on all fronts ... We can't just stop here.”Having formerly served as a pastor, activist and columnist in Durham, N.C., the Rev. Carl Kenney of Bethel Baptist Church is familiar with the region where the attack happened. He moved to Columbia in October 2013 to take care of his father and now serves as an adjunct professor at the MU School of Journalism.While in North Carolina, Kenney said, he "fought against racism, classism, sexism, homophobia and other evils there.” The problems also are present in Missouri, but bigotry here is "more covert,” he said.Kenney said racism in the South often "shows up loudly,” citing the Confederate flag still flown on the Capitol grounds in Columbia, S.C."I think we have a segment of the American population that are still grieving the fact that the South didn't win the Civil War,” Kenney said. "Most of America is wanting to move into a place where people are judged by the content of their character versus the color of their skin — I think most people are on that page. We have to remember that this is one person.”Kenney said his initial reaction to the news of the shooting was "utter dismay and confusion,” which was followed by "rage and disgust” and that this incident "hurts even more” when taking into account other recent events such as the deaths of Mike Brown, Eric Gardner and Tamir Rice in encounters with police."People who are a part of a community that we are a part of — the church — have been murdered in a place that we worship on a daily basis,” he said. "And I think what we are experiencing is a deep level of sadness, and I would even say borderline depression, among the clergy,” Kenney said."We're trying to figure out how to say something that helps heal this pain that people feel. And all at the same time, we have to figure out how we're going to stand up on Sunday morning. What will we say? What will we do? How will we do it? What message will there be for the people after this? This is not an easy thing for us to endure.”This article was first published online on Friday, June 19, 2015 at 9:35 a.m. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
