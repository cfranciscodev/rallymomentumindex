The Facebook page shows more than 700 people attending the event at Buchanan Steps, and videos of the protest are appearing on social media. The event page reads: "Rally for all the black lives lost due to police brutality. "There will be a demonstration on the Buchanan Steps by the Donald Dewar statue, followed by a vigil for Sheku Bayoh.” Mr Bayoh, 31, died in May last year after police responded to reports of a man carrying a knife in Kirkcaldy. The cause of his death has never been established and Mr Bayoh's family continue to call for a public inquiry. A police watchdog has, this month, submitted a report on his death to Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. The Black Lives Matter was last in the Glasgow press when pop star Beyonce called for a minute's silence during her Hampden gig to "take a stand and demand that they 'stop killing us".
