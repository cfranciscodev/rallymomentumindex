Protesters jammed Union Square and clashed with NYPD officers as they marched through the streets of New York City in solidarity with Baltimore activists Wednesday night, briefly shutting down the Holland Tunnel and snarling traffic along the West Side Highway - resulting in at least 100 arrests. What began as a small gathering at Union Square around 6 p.m. swelled to more than 1,000 people, many holding "Justice 4 Freddie Gray" placards while chanting "Black Lives Matter" and continued into the early hours Thursday. Advertisement "Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, shut the whole system down!" the crowd shouted and then broke into several smaller protests, moving on to Herald Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle and everywhere in between. NYPD officers, many wearing riot helmets and carrying handfuls of plastic cuffs, were seen loading several activists into police vans.

He came to the protest with his roommate. "I got a baton to the temple and my roommate got a baton to the stomach," said Carmack, who claims cops retaliated when a protester hurled a water bottle at them.
