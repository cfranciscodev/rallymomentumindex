"It's not a black thing,” Shannon Moten, a Black Lives Matter supporter, said. "It's a people thing.” Under the shadows of the Four Freedoms Monument, it was a rally to remember the black men and women killed by police in America, hoping to spark a conversation about what the supporters call a broken system tinged with systemic racism. "I think everyone is outraged at what's happening, what you're actually seeing and witnessing on video,” Shannon Moten said. "It seems like every time this happens, there's an excuse,” Abel Moten, Shannon's husband, said. "There's a reason that says this is okay.” From the Four Freedoms, it was a march to Haynie's Corner, where the protestors staged a die-in, lying on the ground for 16 minutes, remembering those who would never – and will never – be able to get up again. "All lives do matter,” Shannon Moten said. "Obviously they do, but not always – all lives have not matted because black lives haven't mattered everyday.” "I think people miscontrue it, but it's 'Black Lives Matter Too or Also,'” Abel Moten said. The supporters said this rally is not a warcry directed towards other races of law enforcement, or an effort to elevate the black race over everyone else. "I think there are outstanding police officers,” Shannon Moten said. "I've witnessed that myself. But I believe there are bad apples and I believe we need to have accountability for our police officers and for our government.” "It's about different ideas and coming together to reconcile these ideas and inspire change,” die-in organizer Deonte Meriwether said. At the end of the 16 minutes, the protestors got to their feet, ready to take the next step in their cause. "I just want people to stop moving their thumbs and start moving their feet,” Meriwether said. "And so that's what this is about. We moved our feet today.” While the protestors may still have their share of critics, they said they hope to get their message across that all lives do matter, and that includes black lives.
