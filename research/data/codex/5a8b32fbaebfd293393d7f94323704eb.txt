Benjamin Dripps.The peaceful protest, which lasted about 30 minutes, was held in light of recent grand jury decisions not to indict officers in the deaths of unarmed men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City."Black lives aren't valued in this country and they need to be," said Michelena Wolfe, of Franklin Park. "We're bringing attention to the fact that black lives matter, and the only way anything is ever going to change is if white people do something about it."Saturday's planned protest is one in a series of protests that have taken place in Pittsburgh in the past week.As in previous protests, participants in Saturday's protest took part in a "die-in," in which protesters laid on the ground to express their frustration with what they are calling cases of police brutality.Some protesters also carried signs, and shouts of "No Justice. No peace. No racist police." could be heard.Demonstration organizers had been asked to move their event, according to a statement released by Ross Park Mall on Friday.On Saturday, the mall released the following statement:"Although we asked that the protest be relocated to public property, a small, peaceful demonstration took place at Ross Park Mall at noon today. Participants have dispersed and the mall is open and operating as usual."Julia Johnson, a protest organizer, said, "We need more of us and we need to funnel our energy positively into organizations that are fighting for social justice issues."On Friday, protesters in Oakland blocked traffic on Bigelow Boulevard before moving onto the Parkway East and other area roadways.
