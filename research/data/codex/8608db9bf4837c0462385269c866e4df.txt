Stewards had to scramble into ring road to halt traffic just before hundreds of protesters poured onto the carriageway on Sunday (June 7). One of the organisers - who estimated 1,000 people had attended - said it was "incredibly dangerous for everyone involved" but leaders had tried their best to persuade the people leading the march to turn around. One of the organisers, who gave her name as Georgina, said in a message on Twitter: "As soon as the march went onto the ring road me and another organiser tried our best to get protesters to not go onto the ring road but as there were already so many people it was too difficult. "We didn't go onto the ring road and instead spoke with staff and also the council and tried to help them as best as we could with predicting where the march would go next. "It was incredibly dangerous for everyone involved and should not have happened - also people were held up who could have been key workers/emergency services.

One onlooker said: "The stewards were doing their best but it looked as if they were undermanned and constantly being wrong-footed by whoever was leading the march. "After it headed across the ring road the first time it went into the suburbs before heading back towards the ring road. There were three female stewards in high-viz clothing who had to jog ahead of the crowd and dash into the road, stopping the traffic.

Someone could have been seriously hurt or worse.” An estimated 1,000 people attended the peaceful rally in Broadgate Square earlier that day, one of a number of Black Lives Matter protests which have swept the US and UK and the second so far in Coventry. Outrage at Mr Floyd's death has morphed into wider anger at racial inequality and injustice on both sides of the Atlantic. While the protest in Coventry was marred by the behaviour of some protesters, including another breakaway group that held up traffic on the M6 in a later action, the organisers hailed the main rally as "incredibly positive”.

The majority of protesters wore masks and tried to keep space between groups though there was little sign of social distancing to guard against the spread of Covid-19 by the time the march started. Georgina said: "I feel as though it was incredibly positive at the start. There were some amazing speeches led by young people and also a local MP, Taiwo Owatemi.

Turnout was also incredible - the square was completely full by the end of the speeches - I would say there were around 1,000 people there.” In Bristol, protesters tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and there were clashes between some demonstrators and police in central London. However, Georgina feels that the media has amplified negative aspects of an overwhelmingly positive and peaceful movement triggered by the death of the unarmed black man in an encounter with the police outsider a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

All coverage has been highly negative and there has been very little focus on all of the very positive aspects of marches including powerful speeches and huge turnout.” The US has been convulsed in protests after footage emerged of police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck as he gasped for breath and pleaded for help. He and three other officers have been charged over the incident on May 25. Chauvin faces charges including the most serious count of second-degree murder. His three colleagues, who helped restrain Mr Floyd, are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. CoventryLive has approached Event Support Team and Coventry City Council for comment about the stewards on the ring road. livecoventryFollow @live_coventryMore OnPoliticsCoventry Ring RoadBlack Communities NewsallMost ReadMost RecentCoventry City CouncilPrimary school closes to key worker children after travellers camp in groundsCoventry City Council is taking steps to move the camp onHospital's concern at 'significant' number of Covid-19 patientsGeorge Eliot HospitalInvestigations are taking place with Public Health England and NHS EnglandAction to tackle Amazon lorries cutting through residential roads in CoventryAmazonNew cameras and signs are going inCoronavirus-related deaths have increased in Coventry despite national dropCoronavirusA slight rise has been recorded in coronavirus-related deaths, the latest official figures showWatch: Giant oxygen tank dumbfounds drivers as it heads to WarwickshireTransportIt will be a lot closer to home today and Friday, as it completes its destination to WarwickshireWarwickshire PoliceMan arrested after fatal stabbing in LeamingtonNine arrests have been made in connection with the incidentWhen the torrential rain will be over for Coventry and Warwickshire -
