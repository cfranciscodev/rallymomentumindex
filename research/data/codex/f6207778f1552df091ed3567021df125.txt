We're creating a community space where people can process all of this violence and brutality."Monday updates10:30 p.m. — Mayor Greg Fischer and interim police chief Robert Schroeder held a press conference during which Schroeder denied police used tear gas during the night's protests. He did, however, say police used pepper bullets, an acoustic device, rounds that released paint on protesters and impact rounds on a car. Courier Journal journalists on the ground described a green gas in the air that burned the eyes and throat. The Courier Journal posed a question about the gas during the Facebook press conference, but it was not answered.Courier Journal reporter Hayes Gardner talked to a 23-year old man who said he goes by Issa Fixit during Monday night's protest. "They got comfortable," he said. "The police got comfortable. It went from them being comfortable, to them being agitated. They're stopping our marches, started saying the cars couldn't go. Okay, so we're back to blocking streets, back to square one, back to the drawing board.”Fixit said he assumes he'll see police in riot gear again this week."And they should expect to see way more people come outside,” he said.

Saturday If you happened to be in downtown Louisville earlier Saturday and looked up to the sky, you may have noticed a plane flying and pulling along a banner related to Breonna Taylor."BREONNA WAS ESSENTIAL. DEFUND LMPD," the banner said.UltraViolet, a nonprofit dedicated to ending violence against women and fighting sexism, and Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, commissioned the banner in coordination with Black Lives Matter Louisville.The plane flew from the West End to the East End between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.The groups said the message was meant to celebrate the life of Taylor, who was an ER tech, while also calling for the defunding of the Louisville Metro Police Department."Breonna was an essential member of the Louisville community, an essential worker, and her life mattered," said UltraViolet Executive Director Shauna Thomas in a statement. "We stand in solidarity with her family, and friends and are working in conjunction with Black Lives Matter Louisville activists who are demanding justice for her death, to keep up the pressure on all responsible parties. The LMPD must be held accountable for these horrific and racist acts.""Almost three months have passed since Breonna Taylor was horrifically murdered in her home and her family has yet to see anything resembling justice," added Scott Roberts, the senior director of criminal justice campaigns at Color of Change. Instead we have seen more evidence of the police department's lies, obfuscation and system abuses."Taylor's name and image have become common sights around Louisville following weeks of protests over her death.Christopher 2X Game Changers, a local nonprofit that is named after the community activist and dedicated to promoting early childhood education, is behind three new billboards around the city.Each billboard includes a photo of Taylor and mentions how the 26-year-old was a "game changer" herself during her life, 2X told The Courier Journal.Two of the billboards are on the sides of the Kentucky International Convention Center in downtown Louisville, and the third billboard is off Interstate 65 by the Kentucky Expo Center, according to 2X.FridayThe Louisville Metro Police Department's Bomb Squad along with federal authorities are investigating a set of explosions that went off Thursday night as protesters marched near Waterfront Park, according to officials.Chief of public services Amy Hess said during a Friday morning media briefing that a "large explosion" left a crater on the side of the road as protesters headed on Witherspoon Street by Waterfront Park.A second explosive then went off nearby, causing "significant property damage," Hess said.The blasts damaged a "surrounding structure," gate and exit sign and resulted in the crater that was roughly a foot and a half long, according to Hess and LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay.LMPD's Bomb Squad along with the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to the scene of the blasts and are investigating, Hess said."We're very lucky that no one was injured in either blast," Hess said. "This type of behavior obviously creates great risks to our community and will not and cannot be tolerated."Hess said authorities are still determining what exactly caused the blast, but "based on the noise, it is certainly louder than any fireworks we have heard to date" and sounded "consistent with an explosive device," she added.No arrests have been made in connection with the blasts, and Hess said authorities do not know at this time if a protester or someone seeking to harm the protesters set off the explosives.Still, Hess reiterated that police "have reached out to protesters to try to find a safer way to demonstrate and express themselves.""But if we continue to see these unsafe behaviors, we must take action to stop it," Hess said. "Given the escalating safety concerns from what we saw last night, we will again increase our presence tonight and take steps to stop the reckless, dangerous behavior."In other news from the Friday morning briefing:Hess said that while this week's protests have mostly started in the "hub" area by Sixth and Jefferson streets and remained peaceful, the number of protesters in cars that spread out across the city later each night has "dramatically increased" and resulted in some "increasingly dangerous" situations.An example came just after midnight Friday, when police said a woman and her 5-year-old son fell off the hood of a vehicle at First and Jefferson streets. "Thankfully, their injuries were not life-threatening," Hess said. "But frankly, it could have been much, much worse.""We want people to continue to express their right to be heard and push for a more equitable and just society," Hess said. "But we've got to do it safely."• David McAtee wake: The public wake for David McAtee, a West End barbecue stand owner whom a National Guard soldier fatally shot June 1 while attempting to disperse a crowd by 26th Street and West Broadway, taking place Friday afternoon.The public is invited to pay respects to McAtee from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. at St. Stephen Church, 1018 South 15th St., in Louisville.Courier Journal reporter Kala Kachmar was at McAtee's wake and will have a separate story on the somber event later today. McAtee was "in a beautiful white blazer and black and gold casket."McAtee's funeral will be at 1 p.m. Saturday at Canaan Christian Church, 2840 Hikes Lane.ThursdayNo-knock warrants like the one used the night Breonna Taylor was killed have been banned in Louisville after days of protests demanding their prohibition.Louisville's Metro Council unanimously passed Breonna's Law Thursday evening, calling for a total ban of the controversial warrant. A few hundred protesters watched the vote on a large screen situated on the steps of Metro Hall, erupting in cheers as the vote solidified one of their top demands. • 9 p.m.: After celebrating a ban on no-knock warrants passing in the Metro Council, protesters began marching towards the Highlands from downtown, both in car and on foot. Nearly an hour later, they arrived at the Bardstown Road and Grinstead Drive intersection. Dozens of protesters chanted across all lanes of traffic, with a few cars leading the way and flashing their lights to warn oncoming traffic.Unmarked police cars were stationed on most side streets, reporter Bailey Loosemore said. • 5:50 p.m.: Amy Hess, Louisville's chief of public services, held a short teleconference just before the Louisville Metro Council meeting to address the protests as a rally gathered outside Metro Hall. Hess said she has seen people breaking off from the protest and going mobile to different parts of the city in cars and large caravans of people. She said they have heard of cars taking over both lanes of traffic, and she showed videos of cars doing donuts in the street and people hanging out of the windows of cars. Hess said because of the unsafe traffic reports that there will be an increased presence of LMPD to "be able to help keep the community safe." • 5 p.m.: Outside Metro Hall hundreds gathered in a rally to get rid of the non-knock warrants. This rally began minutes after U.S. senator Rand Paul announced that he is filing legislation to ban no-knock warrants nationwide. When that news was announced at the rally a loud cheer rang from the demonstrators. During the rally, the Louisville Metro Council meeting was being broadcast to the crowd as they waited a decision about the no-knock law. Jecorey Arthur, a local musician and activist who is running for Metro Council, praised the crowd for their work before encouraging them to not give up."We don't need to just take down symbols of white supremacy, we need to take down systems of white supremacy," said Arthur before beginning to rap and dance."We're going to sing, and we're going to dance, and we're going to celebrate today," said Hannah Drake, a local poet and activist."And it is sad that a black woman has to die for this to happen." • 1 p.m.: A group gathered to speak at the former site of the Castleman statue demanding that Mayor Greg Fischer seek justice for the death of Breonna Taylor and asking for Fischer to charge the officers involved in her death. One speaker held a sign that read "Call Mayor Fischer and demand he fire the officers who murdered Breonna Taylor." Participants took turns to speak out against the Castleman statue and why it should have been taken down a long time ago. They said it was a slap in the face to take it down so peacefully to avoid it being torn down compared it to the violent way Taylor died in her apartment."The removal of the statue in this time of national and international uprising against racism just seems like a corrupt offer at racial conciliation," Matrid Ndife, a black woman and the first speaker, said. "I say this because the statue is a lifeless object. A lifeless object was handled with more dignity and honor than the life of Breonna Taylor." One speaker, a white male, spoke out against no-knock search warrants, saying there's no excuse for them.After various people took turns speaking, the group burned a mixture of flowers, plants and sage on the Castleman statue base and poured water around it to signal a new beginning for the area. Leaders of the demonstration invited the public to bring up items and place it on the base too.Soon after the sage burning a fire truck was called to the area. The fire fighters, who were there less than five minutes Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd said, spoke to a demonstrator and left without putting out the sage burning.

Is this the end for other Confederate memorials?• Noon: Louisville Showing Up for Racial Justice gathered in front of LMPD Headquarters Thursday to call on the city to defund the police department.Participants took turns reading off the names of about 65 people killed by police officers in Louisville and around the country. Indigenous people were also highlighted. The crowd was mostly white.Holding a "Black Lives Matter” sign, Cory Lockhart said she attended Thursday's demonstration to affirm that "black lives matter as much as my white life.”"But systematically, we know that's not true, as we see in every system how black and brown people are often harmed” by certain policies, the 47-year-old Louisville resident added.The group also wants the city to ban no-knock search warrants as part of the demands for justice for Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was shot and killed in her own home by police who were executing a no-knock search warrant. Breonna's Law, a proposed ordinance that would limit use of such warrants, cleared a Metro Council committee last week. On Monday, several council members said they would be in favor of a complete ban on the use of no-knock warrants.At Thursday's demonstration, a group of about 70 kneeled in the middle of Seventh Street for 8 minutes and 46 seconds to mark how long a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd. Banners and signs carried messages including "Defund the Police/Invest in Human Needs" and "End White Silence."Related:Why people are calling for Louisville to defund the police — and why the mayor says noWednesday• 10 a.m.: Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and other city officials appeared Wednesday morning in Central Park to share a slew of developments related to the fallout from the deaths of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee.One development related to the recent protests over the deaths of Taylor, McAtee and other black Americans at the hands of law enforcement officers and the criticism of police using tear gas on demonstrators.Speaking in Central Park along with Fischer and Metro Council President David James, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert Schroeder said going forward, the use of tear gas will only be allowed with direct approval from him or a "designee.""I know several peaceful protesters got caught up in situations where tear gas had to be used, and I regret that those people had to experience that, had to go through the effects of tear gas," Schroeder said. "Our officers' intention is never to harm those who are doing the right thing."Read more on the new tear gas-related order here.Here are more takeaways from the Wednesday morning briefing:Fischer announced the launch of a survey related to the search for a new police chief and encouraged community members to complete it. Read more about the survey here.Reviewing survey responses, identifying police chief candidates, conducting interviews and submitting final recommendations to the mayor is expected to take four to six months, Fischer said.Fischer and James stressed the desire for residents to share their thoughts on what they want to see in the next police chief. "Starting the search process for a new LMPD Chief is a very important step in the right direction for our city,” James said. "I look forward to the community and Metro Council playing an active role in selecting the most important appointment the Mayor makes in his administration.”Schroeder said the LMPD detective who applied for the no-knock search warrant at Taylor's apartment in March has been placed on administrative reassignment until questions about "how and why the search warrant was approved" are answered.As protesters around the country call for officials to "defund the police," Fischer signaled he is not in support of those efforts. "I don't believe the community of Louisville wants to defund the police," Fischer said. "That's not our plan to do that either.”Regarding the internal and Kentucky State Police-led investigations into McAtee's death, Schroeder said "hundreds of interviews" are being conducted.Schroeder added that he is not aware of any other unreleased videos that captured National Guard and LMPD personnel firing at McAtee's barbecue business in the West End on June 1, but if "we come across some video that I'm not aware of from, say, a citizen gives us some video that shows what happened, we'd consider releasing that."Asked about sexual assault allegations about Officer Brett Hankison, who fired his weapon during the deadly raid at Taylor's apartment in March, Fischer called them "very troubling." "And that's why it's important that they're looked into immediately, which has been the case," Fischer added. "But you know these type of allegations erode police-community trust."Near the end of Wednesday's briefing, Fischer was also asked about criticism he is facing and some community members calling for him to resign. He said the issues that protesters are fighting for, such as "dismantling systemic racism and poverty," are all the things I've been fighting for in the past.""Look when I was elected for this job and swore the oath, I swore to do it during good times and bad times," Fischer said. "And this is a challenge here in Louisville. It's a challenge all over the country right now there's 150 cities that are going through this and 150 mayors as well."More:Louisville police officer in Breonna Taylor shooting accused of sexual assaultMonday• 6:30 p.m. — As the group at Jefferson Square Park continues through the evening, there are artists, including Elizabeth Wolf, who is painting a picture of David McAtee. As she is painting the picture of McAtee, she said she sees "How he's cooking and doing what he loves doing and how much life he had left and how much he had to give to everyone and it's taken away." Various community activists spoke as well, including Summer Dickerson, who told the people in attendance to get out and vote. "We are going to stand and we are going to get justice, right?" Dickerson asked the crowd. "But let me tell you something, you need to vote. You need to get registered to vote.You have the power to vote for your judges. You have the power to vote for your senate and house, not just the president. All of that. You need to understand that." • 5:30 p.m. — A group of public defenders joined a group at Jefferson Square Park.

And I feel like what happened to her could have easily been me.”Stewart — who for years has created portraits of people killed by gun violence — gifted the actual painting to Taylor's family on Friday."I was just so blessed to be able to do that and make her family happy,” Stewart said.

Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous has said they can be used to "block back chemicals into police's faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems."James said Thursday he did not like that explanation, and that police officers should have approached people with leaf blowers, not fire tear gas on the crowd.Overall, James said that the police department's lack of leadership has led to a public distrust in the law enforcement officers. He also said the lack of body cameras and answers from police in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in her own home on March 13 has been especially frustrating.Wednesday• 11:10 p.m — Protesters marched down Broadway once again Wednesday night after 11 p.m. to express anger over the Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, who were shot and killed by law enforcement officials in Louisville.Another group of protesters had marched through the Highlands.

"And we're not going to ignore the fire just because everyone else, just because all the other houses matter."• 6 p.m — Russell resident Haven Harrington didn't know McAtee well himself but he was well aware of his standing in the neighborhood, he told Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki on Wednesday as he returned to the scene of the early Monday shooting.Harrington came to the gathering outside of David McAtee's business Tuesday trying to make sense of what had happened. He's watched the video released by police but questioned the lack of body camera footage and said it didn't seem like McAtee -- "The man fed the cops for free," Harrington said.He was taken by surprise at the size and consistency of the groups who have gathered on Louisville's streets over the past week. "It's patently obvious to everybody locally, nationally and internationally that the way our criminal justice system interacts with black communities is broken,” he said. "And personally I think it's by design. It's designed to overcriminalize, to overpolice black communities. And you can only overpolice, harass people to a point. There comes a breaking point.”Sporting a 2007 Russel neighborhood Jazz Festival T-shirt, Harrington pointed to the Kroger across the street. Damage the store took in a Tuesday looting was troubling, he said."But I understand where the anger is coming from, and I understand why people are lashing out,” he added. • 5:30 p.m — A group of law enforcement officers helped protesters in downtown Louisville load packs of water bottles in their cars.On Saturday, Louisville law enforcement officers smashed milk jugs and cases of water protesters had stockpiled on corners.
