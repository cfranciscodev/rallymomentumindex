(Photo: Caitlyn Jordan/News Sentinel)"Today's event is about bringing the community together,” said rally organizer Trevor King. "If you are open to have a conversation, then you are doing your part."This is not a political event. This is a human event. Maybe Donald Trump should learn that. This is not political. It's human,” he told The Oak Ridger.A small group of counter protesters, one carrying a sign reading "White safety matters,” made their presence known. "A lot of people seem to think it's weird that we're here,” police chief Smith told reporters. "We're part of the community. We're not on an opposite side of the community.” Listening and having conversations together were the themes in Smith's comments to the crowd: "Tell us what's on your mind. We can always look to ways to improve how we do our job, improve the way we provide service to our citizens."Buy PhotoOak Ridge's police chief Robin Smith walks in the Black Lives Matter march in Oak Ridge, Tenn., on Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (Photo: Caitlyn Jordan/News Sentinel)Signs at the event referenced not just Floyd, but also Ahmaud Aubrey and Breonna Taylor, whose deaths have become flashpoints around the country. Inspiring moments were balanced with sharp criticism. "I'm tired of somebody getting offended when we say that black lives matter,” former coach Colquitt said. "We know that all lives matter, but it seems that our black lives don't.”"I think we are blessed to have a police force in Oak Ridge that cares about black lives,” Pastor Flynn said in an interview. Graham, in his speech, asserted that the department has room for improvement."See, Oak Ridge, despite the job that you're trying to do, even you have skeletons in your closet,” he said to applause after mentioning the name Eugene Rod Harris. Oak Ridge police officers killed Harris in 2010.
