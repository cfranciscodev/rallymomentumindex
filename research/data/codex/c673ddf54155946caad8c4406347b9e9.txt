In St. Louis, a group of protesters rushed the stage at a prayer service, bringing the event to a halt until police arrived. In New York, there was a "die-in” outside Bloomingdale's, in the heart of an upscale shopping area, while in Boston, similar "die-ins” took place on streets between Boston Common and the Public Garden and then in front of the State House. The nation's celebration of King's birthday Monday was punctuated by protest this year, as a new generation of young activists, angered by the deaths of several unarmed African Americans in confrontations with police, demanded that the traditional rituals of speech making, community service, and prayer breakfasts give way to denunciations of injustice and inequality. "The events that have happened have kind of diminished his dream a little bit,” said Aleah Hutchinson, 17, who attended the King Day parade in Athens, Ala. "He wanted us all to work together in unity, but when certain events occur, like the events in Ferguson and the Trayvon Martin case, it kind of diminishes his dream a little bit because at that point, we're not working together.” In Atlanta, a showdown occurred between the civil rights old guard and the new, more boisterous generation of protesters, many of whom were catalyzed to action by the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York, both at the hands of the police. The protesters argued that the holiday had become corrupted by corporate involvement, diluting King's ideas. So with signs, slogans, and shouts, they inserted themselves into the annual parade as it made its way down Peachtree Street. Several times, the group sat and lay en masse in the middle of the street, raising fists toward the air as police pleaded with them to move on. "We're going to reclaim MLK's holiday!” activist Aurielle Marie yelled at the Atlanta protest.
