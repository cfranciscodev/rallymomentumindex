Punches were thrown as protesters started scuffling with police, who brought out riot shields. At least two men were taken aside by police. One man was handcuffed and left over a fence on a side where protesters were gathered. Police set up the fence to separate protesters from Trump supporters, but one apparent Trump supporter made his way to the protesters' side, engaging in a shouting match with them until police pulled him away.Earlier, Richmond Police Chief Alfred Durham said the protest was so "peaceful” in Festival Park across from the Coliseum, "It's not even a protest.”But Durham said police were ready for the marchers, whose progress was marked by a police aircraft making a wide circle over downtown Richmond."We'll be prepared for whatever they present to us,” the chief said at about 8 p.m., the scheduled start of the Trump rally.Protesters in Monroe Park said they also were prepared for confrontation with police — as leaders advised participants to carry two bottles of water, one to drink and the other to flush pepper spray out of their eyes."No Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA. (Expletive) Trump!” the group chanted as they began a march that blocked part of northbound Belvidere Street. Others chanted, "Black lives matter!”Police had vowed not to allow violent confrontations between protesters and Trump supporters like those that occurred a week earlier after a Trump rally in San Jose, Calif. "We don't want to be a story,” Durham told reporters Thursday. "We refuse to let anybody come here and tear our city up.”At least three volunteer "legal observers” for the American Civil Liberties Union at Monroe Park were on hand to ensure people's rights were not violated.One volunteer said the crew would record interactions between residents and police, as well as any interactions in which someone's rights potentially are being violated.As Corey Stewart, Trump's Virginia chairman and a Republican candidate for governor, arrived at the arena, he said he expected a peaceful evening, unlike the chaos that has erupted outside Trump rallies elsewhere."There's just a different level of civility here in Virginia,” Stewart said.Among the police precautions was a policy of keeping the plaza around the Coliseum clear of anyone who wasn't entering the arena for the rally or gathering in Festival Park to protest. Durham said he created the "public safety zone” on advice from law enforcement officials in California. "Unless you go in, you don't need to be hanging around in case something happens,” he said.Initially, at least, the protests sounded like a pep rally, with a group chanting "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has to go,” as the candidate's supporters walked up the center steps to the Coliseum entrance. One group offered white roses and signs of peace — "Build Kindness, Not Walls.”Jason Aldrich, 32, of Richmond used a "Trump Bucket” to pick up cigarettes and other trash for more than an hour."I figured there's enough hate going on now. This is where I'm putting my hate. It gets something done,” Aldrich said.
