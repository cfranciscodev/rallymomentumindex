Although it was an unusual quietness for the busy Elliott University Center, the message was still heard loud and clear. Dozens of University of North Carolina at Greensboro students lined the main hall of the EUC and either sat, stood or laid in silence during a demonstration that was part of "I Matter Monday.” Some of the students had tape over their mouths along with the names of people killed in police-involved shootings on their shirts. "To me, their events speak louder than we ever could,” said student Jane White, organizer of "I Matter Monday.” White says it was important for her classmates to know that each individual has a voice, which is part of why she wanted to focus the demonstration under the phrase "I Matter.” Odie Roberson says he was thinking about his son as he participated. "When I think about how valuable he is to me and how someone can just take his life without any good cause, it makes me emotional, so that's part of what I became emotional about,” Roberson said. Aubrey Clark was so moved by the demonstration that she began hugging the participants. "I just wanted to hug them and let them know, 'I love you, I support you, what you're doing is completely legitimate,'” she said. At one point, the silence was broken when White led students to repeat sentences including, "It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win.” The demonstration ended with participants hugging one another and telling someone nearby "I love you.” University administrators were at the demonstration to make sure other students could get to class and other locations without disruption. 36.072635-79.791975 Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Must-See Stories Local school bus drivers discuss possible options for upcoming school year News / 8 hours ago Video Greensboro city council raises concerns about security at bus depot after complaints of mistreatment News / 8 hours ago Video Winston-Salem council member tests positive for COVID-19 News / 7 hours ago Video Piedmont teen paralyzed after trampoline trick, fighting to recover News / 6 hours ago Video NC bowling alleys, skating rinks could reopen under new bill News / 12 hours ago Video Guilford County Schools plans to resume high school fall sports, marching band training in July News / 7 hours ago More Must-See Stories More News Stories Piggly Wiggly opening in food desert in east Greensboro by Danielle Jackson / Jun 17, 2020 GREENSBORO, N.C. -- A franchise grocery store is in the works for the southeastern portion of Greensboro.
