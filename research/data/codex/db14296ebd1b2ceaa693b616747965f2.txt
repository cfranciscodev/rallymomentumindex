Photos on Twitter showed protesters holding signs near stores such as Gucci, Saks Fifth Avenue, Microsoft and the Galleria's skating rink. One sign called former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson a murderer. As protesters marched with signs, it looked like business as usual inside the Apple store's second floor location. Some participants were lying on the ground in protest -- a pose being called a "die in" at sites around the country. One "die in" was held outside the Prada store, according to a photo on Twitter. While ice-skaters glided on the Galleria's ice rink, protesters a floor above lay on the ground in the pose. Representatives at both the Saks and Microsoft stores declined to comment on the protests. The Facebook event page for the protest displayed pictures of the security gates at the Galleria's Macy's location closed to customers. That event page called for protesters to begin their demonstrations at the Starbucks location at the corner of Post Oak and Westheimer. Protesters also clogged escalators, according to accounts. The hashtag #HoustonProtest is full of photos from the events. Some stores made the decision to temporarily close their doors to the protesters, leaving customers inside for the duration. HPD Spokesman John Cannon said Saturday there had been no reports of mass arrests in the area related to the protests. On Sunday morning, he confirmed that no arrests had been made. At the corner of Westheimer and Post Oak protesters held signs on the sidewalks and chanted slogans to passersby. Traffic was moved along as smoothly as it usually does on a busy Saturday aftenoon.
