"It Just Might Be Okay," directed by Chris & Blak Impakt Studio, is a song from Lupe's 2006 debut, Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor, and the visual comes just in time.The video follows normal people throughout the everyday lives, from hanging on the block, to socializing at the park and business owners working. It shows the real aspects of inner city living, including a memorial for a fallen loved one on a wire pole. The video then shows clips from peaceful "Black Lives Matter" protests. One of these gatherings was in support of the late Rekia Boyd, who was shot by a police officer in March of 2012. Dante Servin, the officer who fired the shot, was found not guilty on Apr. 20.
