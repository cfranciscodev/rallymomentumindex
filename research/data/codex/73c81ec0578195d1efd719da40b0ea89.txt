It also has led to similar protests in football stadiums on high school campuses.Some examples:At Waggener High School in Louisville, Ky., on Sept. 9, a player took a knee as his teammates stood next to him. A number of players had knelt as the team lined up, but eventually rose as the music starting playing, according to a story in USA Today.At Garfield High School in Seattle, the entire football team, including the coaches, took a knee during the national anthem last Friday night before their game against West Seattle High.At Dwyer, three Palm Beach Lakes players knelt during the national anthem Friday as their teammates stood beside them.Student-athletes at public schools such as Palm Beach Lakes have the right to expressive conduct under the First Amendment, a point made clear by the School District of Palm Beach County in an email sent to principals last week."If students kneel during the playing of the national anthem, there should be no consequences or interventions for this action," read the email. "Additionally, there should be no threats or warnings made to students if they kneel."Discipline only could be enforced if a student's conduct was disruptive or vulgar.State law requires students to stand for the national anthem as well as the Pledge of Allegiance, though students can opt out of reciting the pledge with written permission.A spokesman for the Florida High School Athletic Association said Tuesday it has no bylaw that prohibits athletes from kneeling during the national anthem.Rams coach Al Shipman said Monday he addressed the national anthem issue with his players before their game against the Panthers, but said there was no organized plan to protest.Last week at practice, Shipman said he would support his players if they chose to kneel."If one or some of my kids were to ask me to do that, I wouldn't have an issue with it," he said.Palm Beach Lakes running back Jalen Wright chose to kneel last Friday prior to his team's game against Dwyer."Take a knee, people riot," he said Tuesday. "Take a bullet, people quiet."Many public schools in Palm Beach County, such as Forest Hill and Palm Beach Gardens, haven't addressed the national anthem issue, their football coaches said.Neither has Cardinal Newman, though coaches at the West Palm Beach private school actively encourage their football players to stand during the national anthem."We do things as a team," Crusaders coach Brian Pulaski said. "We all stand. Football games are not a platform for a political agenda."Gators coach Rob Freeman agreed."The kids are here to play sports and learn some lessons," he said. "I don't think a political statement should be a part of it." Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
