Four protesters were arrested during a police brutality protest and march, including during a confrontation over whether protesters could march in the street Saturday on the Magnificent Mile, a protest spokesman said Saturday. Police confirmed that four people were taken into custody about 2 p.m. in the 700 block of North Michigan Avenue and charges against them were pending but did not immediately have more details Saturday night. Advertisement Organizers said in a release that police did not allow people who were part of the National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality to march in the roadway of Michigan Avenue from the Chicago Water Tower, 806 N. Michigan Ave., despite a permit allowing them to do so. At the start of the march, "police viciously attacked marchers, ripped a banner out of their hands, threw several to the ground, slammed their bicycles into others, piled up on top of some and arrested at least four people," according to the release. Advertisement The permit, however, also gave police the authority to "limit the available portion of the public way" if one lane of traffic or the sidewalk were enough to accommodate all protesters, according to a copy of the permit supplied by organizers. Video from the protest posted on Instagram on Saturday showed a short confrontation with police before demonstrators began marching south on Michigan Avenue. At one point, the video showed protesters blocked traffic on Wacker Drive at Michigan for a time. Check back for updates.
