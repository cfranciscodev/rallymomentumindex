CLEVELAND — Demonstrators marched nearly 4 miles across Cleveland's west side and jammed traffic in one of two Martin Luther King Jr. Day protests planned in the city to oppose police brutality. About 60 people gathered yesterday at the recreation center where a Cleveland police officer fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Their march ended at the city's public square. Police spokesman Ali Pillow said that at least three people were arrested. He provided no further details. A second 4-mile march was scheduled for the city's east side. The protests were part of a national effort led by the Coalition Against Police Violence. Similar demonstrations were held in other U.S. cities.
