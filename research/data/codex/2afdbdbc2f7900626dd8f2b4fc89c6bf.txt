Police in riot gear descend on Beale Street after earlier demonstration ended peacefullyLaura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Published 7:12 p.m. CT May 30, 2020 | Updated 4:25 p.m. CT June 7, 2020CLOSE Demonstrations between police and protesters in Memphis turned violent late Saturday night. Memphis Commercial AppealCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAbout two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday night, a confrontation between a crowd of people and a team of police officers in riot gear and some on horseback played out on Beale Street.Police had set up a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre to separate officers from the crowd. Some people in the crowd crossed the barricade to the police side. An officer on horseback appeared to try to steady his horse from hitting a protester.Buy PhotoThe fourth night of demonstrations in Memphis, Tenn., on Saturday, May 30, 2020, saw protesters face off with police in riot gear near the Orpheum on South Main Street. The protests are in reaction to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal)A chaotic few seconds followed: police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air.Later, the crowd chanted "No justice, no peace." The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. It ended without arrests and police did not interfere with the march. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street.But after 11 p.m., a group of people began to argue with police officers and sheriff's deputies near Beale Street. The crowd grew to about 60. Some officers arrived with riot shields.It's not clear if the people in the later crowd participated in the earlier march. Nor was it clear how the confrontation began. Two people in the crowd said a person was playing the drums and that officers told him to stop playing, triggering a reaction from the crowd. Other people talked about police breaking up a party. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers on the scene, including one armed with a long gun.

(Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal)Whatever the origin of the police response, the situation soon turned back to the issue of police brutality.One of the main people arguing with police was Darin Alston, who brought up George Floyd's death. Others tried to deescalate the argument, saying that they didn't want another incident.As police moved back towards to the Orpheum, someone in the crowd jumped onto a police car. Police barricaded themselves at the intersection of Beale and Main by the Orpheum. An officer was seen pushing people in the crowd. Soon more officers with shields, helmets and other riot gear arrived."No justice, no peace," said Diasha Graham, who was part of the crowd. "No race is safe. We all are dying. We need to unite and make a change. And make a difference, all as one." The standoff ebbed and flowed. After police horses arrived and the barriers tumbled, the situation appeared to calm down. In announcements over loudspeakers, police told people to clear the area. Then about 12:45 a.m., officers were beating their riot shields with batons and chanting "Move!" They began moving forward in a phalanx from the Orpheum down Beale Street. At least one woman was tackled, someone set off a firework and someone threw a bottle.Seven people were arrested early Sunday morning during the confrontation. The woman who was tackled, Victoria Jones, was charged with disorderly conduct, rioting and resisting detention. She was released on her own recognizance. The other six people faced a variety of charges including disorderly conduct. They remained in police custody on Sunday afternoon. Details on any injuries or arrests weren't immediately available early Sunday morning.Police officers on the scene referred questions to the department's public information officers, who didn't respond immediately to an email inquiry.CLOSE Memphis police and protesters clashed May 30 on Beale Street in Downtown Memphis. Memphis Commercial AppealReporters saw officers tackle at least two people, Jones and a man. A woman tried to put herself between the officers and the woman who was arrested, but it's unclear if this second woman was also detained. By 1:15 a.m. the confrontation appeared over and people had cleared the street.Memphis pastor and activist DeVante Hill, who helped with the earlier protest march, commented on Twitter: "Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main. MPD definitely (incited) them with riot gear, horses and AR-15s . . . "He said two people were arrested, but this could not immediately be confirmed."I really believe we can do this. I truly believe we can do this another way. A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well," Hill wrote.

(Photo: Henry Taylor / The Leaf-Chronicle)Just after 2 a.m., Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer said she and a group of people headed to 201 Poplar to support protesters who had been arrested."We weren't here to protest,” she said. "We were here for bail support.”She said jail officials told her and the group to leave and come back at 4 a.m. They decided to wait in the parking lot since it was nearly 4 a.m. She said officers then started to count down and told the group they had five minutes to leave the area or "lethal force” would be used to remove them.She said they had a right to be there so they refused to leave."They arrested people that we know, people that we love,” she said. "They are leaders in our community, peaceful folks.”Around 3:30 a.m., about 50 people were outside 201 Poplar, waiting on the sidewalk and grassy area in front of the Downtown building.There was no noticeable law enforcement presence at that time, although Memphis police officers had been there earlier with riot shields, followed by Shelby County sheriff's deputies.By 4:30 a.m., only about 10 people remained outside 201 Poplar.Earlier Memphis protest ended peacefully despite some tensionsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInSaturday protests in Memphis turn violent FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Photo: Joe Rondone / The Commercial Appeal)By 9 p.m., the group had completed a fast-paced walk through Downtown and returned to the Lorraine Motel.DeVante Hill said the protesters would use their ability to protest with order and decency. He said tearing up businesses will make them look bad."With this type of momentum, we can do anything," Hill said.Just after 9 p.m. hundreds of protesters went back to their cars and walked north on Mulberry Street.David Schuermann, 69, stood on his porch and applauded. A pair of protesters handed him a cardboard sign that had "Black Lives Matter” written in marker."I think they're doing a good job being peaceful,” said Schuermann of the protesters. He said he thought it stayed that way because the police presence didn't antagonize the crowd."The police have been pretty good. I think they've been well behaved, and the protesters have been well behaved," Schuermann said.He saw similarities in the death of Floyd and others at hands of police to that of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 100 yards away, 52 years earlier."I was a teenager when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. ... It's the same damn thing. It keeps happening,” Schuermann said. "We need to solve the problem, which is systemic racism.”Earlier in the day, another group of about two dozen protesters met outside the Mt. Moriah police station, according to a video of the event posted on Facebook.In the video, the protest organizer said the group was there to stop police brutality.A timeline of protests in MemphisFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInProtesters against police brutality gather along Beale Street FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
