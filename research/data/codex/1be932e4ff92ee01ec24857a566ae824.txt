Amy Klobuchar at St. Louis Park High School on Sunday, March 1, 2020. The protesters took over the stage, and Klobuchar eventually canceled the rally. Daris says that he was wrongly imprisoned in Minnesota for 17 years for crimes he did not commit.

The outcome left supporters disappointed and served as an unexpected punctuation mark for the evening, which was intended to be Klobuchar's send-off rally as she headed on a multi-state tour leading into Super Tuesday, in which 14 states, including Minnesota, will hold primaries. Minnesota Politics Explained: Sign up for our new email newsletter, with the latest news and insight from the Minnesota Capitol. On Sunday afternoon, Klobuchar's stature was poised to be elevated as she found herself still standing amid a shrinking field of candidates. Following a decisive victory in South Carolina on Saturday, Joe Biden has assumed the role of chief rival to frontrunner Bernie Sanders — especially after former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out Sunday afternoon. Billionaire Tom Steyer dropped out Saturday. Klobuchar, Minnesota's thrice-elected U.S. senator and perhaps the most popular political figure in the state, finished a distant sixth in South Carolina, underscoring her need for a strong showing Tuesday. Several supporters said they thought Buttigieg's departure boded well for her, as the two seemed to be vying for a similar group of relatively moderate Democratic voters. But Klobuchar found her home turf of St. Louis Park High School uncomfortable ground as Sunday evening began. Several dozen protesters entered the high school gym chanting slogans and raising signs demanding she drop out of the race. Among the chants were "Black Lives Matter” and "Free Myon.” The entourage was rallying behind the cause of Myon Burrell, who was twice convicted for killing 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards in 2002 — convictions that have come under scrutiny following an Associated Press investigation that revealed serious flaws. Klobuchar was Hennepin County attorney during part of the case's prosecution. She has said any new evidence should be examined but has stopped short of calling for the case to be reopened. The actual conviction for which Burrell is serving a life sentence was prosecuted not by Klobuchar but by her successor, current Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. Freeman has said he has reviewed the evidence and concluded that the case against Burrell is "quite strong.” The protesters occupied the stage for perhaps an hour while Klobuchar supporters looked on, generally quiet but increasingly impatient. "They've has their chance, and now Amy should have hers,” said Barb Swenson, a teacher, labor activist and Klobuchar supporter from North Branch. Swenson said any change to Burrell's status should begin with a lawsuit, not a disruptive protest. Swenson's comments came as negotiations between Klobuchar campaign officials and organizers of the protest played out. According to those on both sides, an agreement was reached that would involve Klobuchar meeting with some of the protesters or relatives of Burrell. However, Klobuchar canceled the event after the protesters "backed out” of the agreement, a campaign spokesman said. That wasn't the case, according to Leslie Redmond, president of the Minneapolis NAACP. "We're disappointed, too,” said Redmond, one of the protest organizers. She said that while she was pleased Burrell's case was gaining attention, it was never the protesters' intent to shut down the event.
