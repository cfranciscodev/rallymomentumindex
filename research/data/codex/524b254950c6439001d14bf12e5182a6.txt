School officials told FOX 23 that University of Tulsa cornerback Keanu Hill kneeled as the 'Star Spangled Banner' played ahead of their game in Columbus, Ohio. https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/775121402177421315 In recent weeks, several athletes have protested during the national anthem, following in the footsteps of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Following Saturday's game, the University of Tulsa released the following statement: "Following the Tulsa team prayer at Saturday's football game in Columbus, student-athlete Keanu Hill continued to kneel as the National Anthem was played. A university setting is a place of free expression and open discussion of differing perspectives and opinions, however the actions of one do not speak for an entire group and-in this instance- not for the University of Tulsa Athletics. The National Anthem and salute to the flag are ways we show thanks for our freedom and respect for the men and women who have served our country.‚Äù Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Latest News Oklahoma Historical Society makes change to highlight black history in Oklahoma Local / 1 min ago Father charged in Michigan fire that killed wife, 3 children News / 26 mins ago Video Costco, Target and other stores relax coronavirus safety policies News / 28 mins ago Emails suggest CDC director influenced state health decisions related to Colorado meat plant National / 46 mins ago Oklahoma City Zoo launches live mountain lion cam Local / 51 mins ago Gallery OSBI investigating allegations of misconduct by Canadian County court clerk News / 1 hour ago OSDH: COVID-19 Oklahoma numbers update unavailable due to technical difficulties News / 1 hour ago Days before Medicaid expansion vote, state agency announces plans to seek proposals for SoonerCare Local / 2 hours ago Get ready for beautiful sunsets: Saharan dust heading to US by next week News / 2 hours ago Gallery Oklahoma City Philharmonic hosting annual fundraiser with virtual show house option News / 2 hours ago Video 10 last-minute Father's Day ideas for 2020 News / 1 hour ago Mama June admits to $2,500-a-day meth habit News / 3 hours ago Video More News Top Stories Oklahoma Historical Society makes change to highlight black history in Oklahoma Father charged in Michigan fire that killed wife, 3 children Video Costco, Target and other stores relax coronavirus safety policies Emails suggest CDC director influenced state health decisions related to Colorado meat plant Oklahoma City Zoo launches live mountain lion cam Gallery OSBI investigating allegations of misconduct by Canadian County court clerk OSDH: COVID-19 Oklahoma numbers update unavailable due to technical difficulties Days before Medicaid expansion vote, state agency announces plans to seek proposals for SoonerCare Get ready for beautiful sunsets: Saharan dust heading to US by next week Gallery Oklahoma City Philharmonic hosting annual fundraiser with virtual show house option Video 10 last-minute Father's Day ideas for 2020 Mama June admits to $2,500-a-day meth habit Video Read more stories More Stories Study claims Oklahoma has lowest recovery for unemployment claims in the country OBU announces calendar changes to fall semester to prevent spread of COVID-19 Supreme Court rules against Trump administration in decision to end DACA OMRF receives $1.75M federal grant to study impact of coronavirus on Oklahomans Read more stories National News Emails suggest CDC director influenced state health decisions related to Colorado meat plant National / 46 mins ago Missouri parents accused of leaving son with cerebral palsy to live alone for over a month National / 5 hours ago Video 1.5 million more laid-off workers seek unemployment benefits National / 5 hours ago Jean Kennedy Smith, last surviving sibling of JFK, dies National / 6 hours ago 94-year-old 'Nanny' crochets extra special gift for grieving couple National / 7 hours ago Video Chicago high school student charged in murder of transgender woman National / 7 hours ago Video Spice up your summer cookouts: Limited-edition Tangy Pickle Doritos now available National / 7 hours ago World War II forces sweetheart singer Vera Lynn dies at 103 National / 7 hours ago NTSB: Kobe Bryant pilot may have been disoriented in fog National / 7 hours ago Gallery More National Washington D.C.
