CBS2's Brittney Hopper said the march — which began around 3 p.m. — focused on two cases involving police fatally shooting Noel Aguilar and Jesse Delgadillo. Noel Aguilar, 23, was shot by police in May of this year. Jesse Delgadillo, 24, was shot in April 2013. The men's mothers were scheduled to participate in the rally. Witnesses said Aguilar was handcuffed at the time he was fatally shot. It was about a year after and in the same neighborhood where police also gunned down Delgadillo, described as a longtime Aguilar friend. At the time of the shooting, police said Aguilar was a known gang member who tried to take an officer's gun. A deputy was also shot in the stomach and survived his injuries. Officials also said Aguilar was shot when he grappled with an officer for his weapon. Police said Delgadillo was shot after he pulled a weapon during a confrontation. "There's a problem going around,” said one protester, "with officers shooting people. It's up to us to stand. It's up to us to really make a stand and say something is wrong. Our justice system isn't perfect, it isn't good. And I'm here to just bring attention to it.” Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Follow Us facebook_urltwitter_urlyoutube_urlinstagram_urlreddit_urllinkedin_url Our | NewsletterMost Viewed Four OC Restaurants Close As COVID Cases Jump 'That '70s Show' Actor Danny Masterson Charged With Forcible Rape Of 3 Women Man Shot To Death While Sitting In Car In East LA LASD Deputies Fatally Shoot Man Identified As Half-Brother Of Robert Fuller, Injure Woman In Kern County 14-Year-Old Girl Shot, Killed At Family Gathering In San Bernardino Man Killed, 2 Hurt In SUV Crash Into Silver Lake Oyster Bar LA County Reports Record Daily Increase In COVID Cases; Officials Say Key Metrics Holding Torrance Police Locate Woman Accused Of Going On Racist Tirade, No Arrest Made San Bernardino JCPenney Among 136 Stores Closing Nationwide; Closeout Sales Underway LA City Council Approves LAPD Budget Cuts; Department Temporarily Stops Overtime Pay Follow Us FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramRedditLinkedIn News LA NewsLA WeatherBusinessConsumerEntertainmentInvestigative Sports LakersLos Angeles Lakers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9ClippersLos Angeles Clippers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9DodgersLos Angeles Dodgers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9AngelsLos Angeles Angels Of Anaheim News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9RamsLos Angeles Rams News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9ChargersLos Angeles Chargers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9College Sports Watch + Listen MusicVideoPodcastsSeen On TVOnly CBSBest Of LABest Of Orange County Corporate About UsAdvertiseConnect Station Info About CBS2 / KCAL9 ©2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
