"Want to organize a #blacklivesmatter march this weekend downtown, everyone come together and get some posters and take a stand,” it read. Saturday night, approximately 700 people took a stand and walked through the center of Indianapolis in a peaceful protest that planted hopeful seeds of solutions. "We just wanted as many people as possible to come down here and take a stand for us as people. We're saying black lives matter but all lives matter,” said Brown. "Let's just not make the march and the protest the only voices that are heard. Let's see what the youth...me and more other people have to say. "We want everyone to remain peaceful. We don't want any more killings. That's the main thing.” The "Black Lives Matter” movement was born in the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in August of 2014. The phrase, "Hands up. Don't shoot,” has become a staple of such protests and organizer Nigel Long walked with his hands in the air as the march left Monument Circle. "All lives do matter,” said Long, "but right now at this point in time we're putting an emphasis on black lives because we're tired of seeing the hashtags on twitter, we're tired of the same things as far as our black males getting shot by police, we're tired of our black males being criminalized and we're tired of our black males being discriminated against. "We had a peaceful protest yesterday where no one got hurt. There's no reason that the whole city can't do something like that.” The protest ended with a rally on the mall near the Central Library as the organizers profusely thanked IMPD for its cooperation and protection as the participants applauded. The next day, the organizers were faced with the question of where their movement, its genesis in a teenage girl's tweet, goes from here "so we can talk about the issues that we face as a community, as a black community, one, and as the youth of Indianapolis,” said Long. "There was many white faces, as we were walking there were many people just coming on,” said Brown. "We had doubters. We had people thinking we wasn't going to be peaceful. "We have to beat the system,” she said. "We have to outsmart, we cannot be violent, we cannot be killing each other, if we're killing each other and police officers are killing each other, there will be no more of us. "We have to become police officers, we have to become lawyers. "It starts off with us. If we don't train ourselves, we can't change the world.” Brown has less than a month to participate in the community meetings she's called for to determine a direction of the movement she unleased with a tweet. On August 8, Brown starts her college career in Alabama studying fashion merchandising.
