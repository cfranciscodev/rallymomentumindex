"I believe we as a community are better than this.”Watkins vowed to contest the charges."Martese has worked hard to ensure his bright future,” he said, "and we intend to fight the criminal charges against him with the utmost vigor.”Watkins also said that despite media reports claiming Johnson had furnished a fake ID, the student supplied a "valid Illinois state identification card issued in 2011" when an employee at the bar asked him for one.
